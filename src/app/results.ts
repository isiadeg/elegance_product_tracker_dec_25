That gauge dropped to around zero on Thursday and shows no sign of significant recovery in the forecast.\n\nMore than 55% of the contiguous United States is in drought, according to the US Drought Monitor, which is the largest area since April.

The views expressed in this piece are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN --\n\nIn light of the verdicts reached this week involving the Parkland, Florida, school shooter, Nikolas Cruz, and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting denier, Alex Jones, our system of justice has come under intense scrutiny.\n\nJoey Jackson Jeremy Freeman\/CNN\n\nGun violence and the tragic consequences of mass shootings continue to trouble our nation. As such, America was focused like a laser beam on what justice would look like to the juries sitting in judgment on both matters.\n\nIn the Parkland case, the school shooter evaded the death penalty, leading many to wonder where justice has gone - or whether that word can even be used in connection with the result. In the Sandy Hook case, the shooting denier was hit with a nearly $1 billion judgment that must be paid to the families. While that looked more like the justice people thirsted for, many are now wondering whether the families will see any of that jury award at all.\n\nTogether, these verdicts call into question whether our justice system is still viable -- or, instead, if it's irreconcilably broken.\n\nThe only reason the Parkland case went to trial was for prosecutors to secure the death penalty. Cruz, who was 19 when he opened fire in Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, had already pleaded guilty last year for his 2018 actions - which left 17 dead and another 17 injured. But prosecutors, in consultation with the families, wanted to pursue death for the shooter.\n\nIn order for that result to be achieved, however, it would have required 12 jurors to unanimously conclude that such a penalty was warranted. Their mission was to decide whether \"aggravating factors\" associated with Cruz's conduct - including the cold, calculated and premeditated nature of his actions - were enough to overcome the \"mitigating factors.\" The defense pointed to such mitigating factors as the drug and alcohol use of his mom while he was still in her womb, as well as his troubled upbringing and the overall turmoil in his life. Ultimately, with three jurors holding out, he will be sentenced to life without parole.\n\nThis verdict left Parkland victims' families livid, with one father saying he was \"disgusted by those jurors.\" His was a sentiment that was widely shared. If actions as twisted, abhorrent, heartless and callous as Cruz's do not warrant death, it's difficult to know of a circumstance that would. No matter what anyone's opinion is about the death penalty, it's hard not to appreciate the anguish and pain of those families, who expected and wanted more. Can the Florida jury's decision here be said to be just?\n\nIn Connecticut, the six jurors in the civil case against Jones unanimously concluded that his lies, his insistence that the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre - which left 26 dead, including 20 children ages 6 and 7 - was a hoax, were defamatory, false and emotionally detrimental to the families. The vast majority of case observers applauded the verdict because of the judgment's size and the message it sent.\n\nGiven the $965 million that the families were awarded, it's hard to say that the system didn't work. But was the award so large as to be uncollectible? Perhaps a smaller award would have meant more by way of justice as his ability to pay may have been more definite.\n\nInstead, questions remain about how much of that award, if any, the families will ever see. Will Jones continue to hide and conceal his money, use bankruptcy to shield himself from liability and stonewall the families with endless appeals and legal maneuvers to stay a step ahead of his creditors?\n\nEither way, the system affords Jones various avenues of appeal and additional avenues of safeguarding his assets. And isn't that exactly what due process is all about? Our laws are designed to allow even the hated amongst us to employ all legal means to avoid judgments and collection. If he attempts to conceal his assets in an unlawful manner, there are avenues that the families can take to thwart his efforts. That's our system at work.\n\nBoth of these cases involved abominable school shootings, deranged (and young) gunmen, senseless violence, and the tragic death of innocent children and selfless teachers and staff. The families impacted by these horrific shootings have been forever altered and have had to relive the agony through these trials. They did this in pursuit of justice that they may, or may not, ever fully see.\n\nBut when we stop to reflect upon the results, perhaps the system worked exactly as intended. Jones has been called out for his misrepresentations and despicable behavior. He is, indeed, paying a reputational price in the public square.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter\n\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAs such, those who spread conspiracy theories may think twice in the future. So even if the families never see any money, they have altered the conspiracy dynamic forevermore, and the consequences to those who spread hatred and lies.\n\nAnd for Cruz, 12 jurors could not reach a unanimous decision as to the penalty. The fallback for the lack of jury unanimity was a life sentence. That's the balance our judicial system provides. So while Cruz didn't get the death penalty prosecutors and families sought, he'll face a punishment that hopefully will force him to spend years, even decades, reflecting on the carnage he wrought.\n\nThe verdicts may be far from perfect, especially for the families involved, but both delivered significant punishments nonetheless. Our judicial system is unquestionably an imperfect one, but in all the controversy, confusion, acrimony, bitter feelings and discord, it's working exactly as it was intended.", "source":{"uri":"edition.cnn.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"CNN International"}, "authors":[{"uri":"joey_jackson@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Joey Jackson", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/media.cnn.com\/api\/v1\/images\/stellar\/prod\/221013123128-08-nikolas-cruz-parkland-trial-1013.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "eventUri":"eng-8099264", "sentiment":0.01960784313725483, "wgt":403550820, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7226365157", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2022-10-15", "time":"17:27:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-15T17:27:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T16:53:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2022\/10\/15\/us\/ukraine-lion-rescue-colorado-scn-trnd\/index.html", "title":"Lions rescued from Ukraine make Colorado sanctuary their forever home | CNN", "body":"CNN --\n\nNine lions that were rescued from Ukraine have arrived safely at their new home in Colorado.\n\nThe big cats were \"urgently relocated\" from Bio Park Zoo in Odessa, Ukraine, when the Russian invasion first began, according to a news release from The Wild Animal Sanctuary.\n\nA convoy transported the lions from Odessa across Moldova to Romania; their journey stretched for over 600 miles, says the sanctuary.

November will show whether they can do it again | CNN Politics", "body":"CNN --\n\nKansas Gov. Laura Kelly is petite, soft-spoken and rarely heard from on the national stage. But on August 2, when Kansans shocked the nation by voting to preserve a right to abortion in the state's constitution, Kelly's statement on the vote read like a new blueprint for Democrats navigating the uncertain politics of the post Roe v. Wade era.\n\n\"Kansans stood up for fundamental rights today,\" Kelly wrote in a tweet. \"We rejected divisive legislation that jeopardized our economic future & put women's health care access at risk.\"\n\nAnother tweet called proponents of the ballot measure \"extremists\" and warned that \"they want to take our state back in time.\"\n\nAll of this in a state that Donald Trump won by double digits. Twice.\n\nKelly, who made national headlines when she was elected to office in 2018, is one of this year's most vulnerable Democratic incumbents as she fights for a second term in her reliably red state.\n\nDespite her full-throated opposition to the ballot measure that would have allowed lawmakers to strip abortion rights from the state's constitution, and her long history of pushing back on abortion restrictions both as governor and during her 14 years as a state legislator, Kelly is very much not centering her campaign on abortion.\n\n\"The vote on August 2 made it very clear how that can be, that Kansans tend to elect to the governor's office a very moderate, commonsense, thoughtful person to run their state and to make sure that the basic services are provided for them,\" Kelly said in an interview. \"What they want me as governor to do is to focus on the kitchen table issues. You know, they want me to focus on the economy. And we have done that.\"\n\nVoters, Democratic candidates and organizers say the issue of abortion has emerged as a source of debate and conversation among voters here, particularly after the referendum. And while the economy is still the top issue, abortion often emerges as a concern.\n\nThat said, Kelly is fighting for political survival in an unusual landscape: one in which economic headwinds and political polarization would seem to make it more difficult for any Democrat in a purple or red state to survive. But it is also one in which a burst of energy, prompted by the Supreme Court's reversal of 50 years of legal precedent on abortion, has given Democrats a fresh opportunity.\n\nKelly has opted to plant her reelection campaign firmly in home-grown Kansas issues: eliminating a grocery tax, funding for schools and her fiscal stewardship of the state.\n\nIt's a strategy designed to counter the efforts by her Republican opponent, state Attorney General Derek Schmidt, to tie her to national Democratic figures like President Joe Biden and US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as well as national issues like immigration, inflation and culture-war issues.\n\nA recent Schmidt ad accused Kelly of supporting \"groups that push critical race theory and the transgender agenda.\n\n\"Laura Kelly won't stand up to the liberal Washington agenda. But I will,\" Schmidt says in the ad.\n\nIn Kansas, registered Republicans outnumber Democrats nearly 2 to 1. And if Kelly is going to replicate the coalition that won her the governor's mansion in 2018, she will both have to maximize Democratic voters and recruit some moderate Republican voters.\n\n\"As a Democrat, you have to have Republican support to win in Kansas, whether statewide or in some of these targeted congressional districts,\" said Tom Bonier, CEO of TargetSmart, a Democratic research firm. \"Republicans make up a majority of the electorate in the state. And so we've seen in the vote on that constitutional amendment in August that a large number of Republicans actually supported the 'no vote' - the pro-[abortion rights] position.\"\n\nAbortion rights remains on voters' minds\n\nOn the ground in Kansas, a familiar story is playing out: The economy is voters' top concern.\n\nBut after the August referendum, where nearly 60% of Kansans voted to protect abortion access, that issue is still on voters' minds.\n\nBoth Kelly and Schmidt have been pressed in recent debates on their positions on abortion.\n\nKelly firmly, but succinctly reiterated her position on abortion, framing it as a form of government overreach into women's bodily autonomy.\n\n\"I think 60% of Kansas said they don't want that government overreach into people's personal lives,\" Kelly said at the Kansas State Fair on September 10, to applause from supporters. \"I have been consistent on my position on this issue since I entered the state Senate 18 years ago. And I will stay consistent, no matter what.\n\nSchmidt has said that the voters' will should be respected, but that the issue is not settled.\n\n\"I do believe that going forward the biggest challenge will be defending those restrictions and limitations that are already on the books,\" Schmidt said. \"I believe they will be subject to legal challenge, I'm committed to defending them going forward.\"\n\nIf anything, the results of the ballot initiative have scrambled perceptions in Kansas of whether abortion is an issue that Democrats can use to win over moderate Republican voters.\n\nRetirees Linda and Jim Schottler are registered Republicans in Manhattan, Kansas, who say the abortion referendum changed the way people talk about the issue - and politics in general - in the state.\n\n\"A lot of people just don't talk politics when they get into a group because they are afraid of stepping on toes,\" Jim Schottler said. \"But since the referendum, I feel like a lot of people are talking about that and maybe trying to loosen the conversation about that polarization.\"d\n\nBut when it comes to national politics and the economy, their mood is far more ambivalent.\n\n\"I'm not sure I agree with Biden on a lot of issues, but I don't agree with the opposite party right now. So it's a difficult situation,\" Linda Schottler said.\n\nYet the couple voted no on the abortion ballot measure and plan to support Kelly in November.\n\n\"We voted no, believing that a woman's right to her own body should be her decision, not someone else's,\" Linda Schottler said.\n\n\"It was just not our right to decide for somebody else,\" Jim Schottler.\n\nAmyJo Kneisel, a Kansas native who recently moved back to the state, says she intends to reregister as a Republican ahead of the general election. Her younger sister, Angela Dawdy, is a Democrat. Despite their opposite political affiliations, abortion access is where they find common ground.\n\n\"I myself have an 11-year-old daughter and I want her to be able to have choices in life. And that's a huge choice for me,\" Dawdy said. \"I just hope that going forward that people make choices based more on the ideology of what's out there, not just Republican or Democrat.\n\n\"I've never been a proponent for abortion, but then again, what's right for me may not be right for somebody else,\" Kneisel said. \"Well, don't tell our dad this, but I might end voting a little bit more Democrat based on what's been going on with the party lately.\"\n\n\"We like to weigh both issues with both parties. So, we don't just go in and blindly vote based on our party. We listen and keep our ear to the ground,\" added Kneisel.\n\n'Kansas was the first indicator'\n\nKelly and Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids, who is running for reelection in Kansas' 3rd Congressional district, are hoping to find many more Republican voters exactly like the Schottlers and Kneisel. In 2020, Davids won her district by a 10-point margin against Republican Amanda Adkins, who is running against her again this cycle.\n\nBut after redistricting, Kansas' 3rd District may be a steeper hill for Davids to climb with the addition of rural and conservative communities. And yet, she says, voters are still raising the issue of reproductive rights with her in conversation.\n\n\"I talk about and address and try to work on issues that people are talking to me about,\" Davids said in an interview. \"I've met with folks who... the purpose of the meeting was to talk about farm bill issues. And then at the end of the meeting, I've had folks say, hey, where are you at on the constitutional amendment.\"\n\n\"People get really emotional when they tell me about this stuff and that they want to make sure that someone like me or some governor or some other politician isn't the one who's telling somebody whether or not they can get access to the care that they need in an emergency situation,\" she added.\n\nThe referendum has also made Democrats in the state more bullish on the prospect of bringing new voters into the electorate - especially young women and voters of color.\n\n\"I think there was a big question as to what impact [the Supreme Court abortion decision] would have on the election and on the November election,\" said Bonier. \"And so Kansas was the first indicator in seeing that women, younger voters, and voters of color were so engaged in that election and turned out at such a high rate.\n\n\"It proves that that issue is something that can motivate these voters to come out in this election that really looked like it was going to be a definitive red wave election.\"\n\nDemocratic organizers like 27-year-old Carla Rivas-D'Amico of Common Sense Kansas have set their sights on the state's Latino community, which accounts for 13% of the state's population and is the fastest growing minority population in Kansas.\n\nIn the August primary, the share of the Latino vote was the second highest in Kansas history, narrowly ahead of their share of the electorate in the 2018 general election, according to the data firm Catalist.\n\n\"The voters sent a really clear message that they want politicians to stay out of their private medical decisions and instead focus on creating jobs, strengthening the economy, and funding our schools,\" said Rivas-D'Amico.\n\nJust before dusk in a strip mall in Olathe, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City, Rivas-D'Amico, whose parents are from Venezuela, gave a training session in Spanish to about 20 Hispanic volunteers who were preparing to canvas in the area. More than one out of every 10 residents in Olathe is Hispanic. She teared up as she described the importance of building the community's political power.\n\n\"We deserve to be persuaded,\" Rivas-D'Amico said.\n\nLater, as she walked the streets of a predominantly working-class Latino neighborhood, Rivas-D'Amico said that voters here talk to her overwhelmingly about the economy, but among organizers, there's newfound encouragement that if they go after these votes, it could make a difference.\n\n\"This is one of the most competitive governor's races and congressional races in the country and every vote makes the difference,\" she said. \"The overwhelming 60% win was unexpected to a lot of people but it restored confidence in the idea that when we get out there and we organize, we talk to each other - which is the only way forward - we win.\"", "source":{"uri":"edition.cnn.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"CNN International"}, "authors":[{"uri":"abby_phillip@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Abby Phillip", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/media.cnn.com\/api\/v1\/images\/stellar\/prod\/221014204007-01-laura-kelly-072722-restricted.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "eventUri":"eng-8099072", "sentiment":-0.05098039215686279, "wgt":403547640, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7226317069", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2022-10-15", "time":"16:26:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-15T16:26:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T15:28:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2022\/10\/15\/us\/louisville-kentucky-detective-cyberstalking-federal-court\/index.html", "title":"Former Louisville detective could face years in federal prison in cyberstalking case | CNN", "body":"CNN --\n\nA former Louisville Metro Police Department detective is possibly facing years in federal prison when he is sentenced next week for using his law enforcement access to a database, obtaining information about women, and stealing sexually explicit photos and videos from them.\n\nBryan Andrew Wilson, 36, is due to be sentenced on Wednesday after pleading guilty in June to one count of conspiring to commit cyberstalking. A sentencing memo filed in the US District Court in Kentucky on Tuesday says Wilson used his law enforcement access to Accurint, a database of public records and nonpublic information, to obtain information about potential hacking victims.\n\nWilson was accused of using the stolen photos and videos to extort the women for more sexually explicit content, federal prosecutors say in court documents.\n\nMeanwhile, Wilson and another former Louisville detective are accused in a separate case involving driving unmarked police vehicles and throwing beverages at civilians before fleeing the scene, according to court documents. Wilson also pleaded guilty in this case, according to a press release from the US Attorney's office.\n\nWilson faces a maximum penalty of 15 years for the cyberstalking and a civil rights violation involving the beverage incidents. In the sentencing memo, prosecutors say that as part of a plea agreement, they recommend to the judge \"a sentence at the lowest end of the applicable Sentencing Guideline range.\"\n\nFederal prosecutors said that Wilson shared the information he obtained from Accurint with a hacker who hacked into the private Snapchat accounts of multiple women to acquire explicit photos and videos.\n\n\"If sexually explicit photographs and videos were obtained, Wilson texted his victims and extorted them, threatening to publish the photographs and videos to their family, friends, and co-workers unless they provided him with additional sexually explicit photographs and videos,\" federal prosecutors write in the court filing.\n\nCNN has reached out to Louisville Metro Police and Wilson's attorney for comment.

Gretchen Whitmer and Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, among other down-ballot Democrats, at a get-out-the-vote rally on October 29, Whitmer's team said in a statement. However, it is currently unclear which Democrats the former President would stump with in Georgia, which is home to high-profile governor and senator races. Both states also have competitive US House races and critical down-ballot contests, some of which feature GOP nominees who have spread false claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe Wisconsin Democratic Party announced on Friday that Obama would campaign with Democratic nominees in Milwaukee, also on October 29.\n\nIn an interview with \"Pod Save America\" that aired Friday night, Obama pointed to down-ballot races as an important test for the Democratic Party.\n\n\"One of the things I want to emphasize in this midterm is the importance of looking not just at the top of the ballot, but all the way down the bottom, because there are governor's races, secretary of state's races, state legislative races that are going to really matter,\" he said. \"It may turn out that in a close presidential election at some point, certification of an election in a key swing state may be at issue.

There were a total of 43 workers eligible to vote.\n\nThe union, Starbucks Workers United, had already won the right to represent workers at two stores in Buffalo, New York, but lost the vote at a third store there, although it is challenging that election result. The union has also filed to hold additional elections at more than 100 Starbucks stores across 26 states.\n\nEven if the union wins all those stores, it will be a fraction of the Starbucks stores nationwide.\n\nCompany filings show Starbucks (SBUX) had 235,000 employees at nearly 9,000 company-operated stores in the United States as of October 2021. The company is throwing significant resources, including visits by top executives to stores holding votes, to convince employees not to unionize.\n\nBut this third win, by such a large margin, could give a lift to the union's closely-watched effort to file for elections at additional stores.\n\nFor its part, Starbucks released a statement, saying, \"As we have said throughout, we will respect the process and will bargain in good faith guided by our principles. We hope that the union does the same.\"\n\nThe organizing effort has been led the young workers in their 20s who make up much of Starbucks' workforce. Employees from the store in Mesa, known as partners in Starbucks' parlance, gathered after the vote and celebrated the outcome. \"This is enormous for the entire country, all across the US. I'm so proud,\" said Tyler Ralston, one of the partners, on a press call that followed the vote. \"The numbers reflect how we all feel. It's a win for labor rights and workers' rights. And I'm so excited.\"\n\nThe supporters said the company's efforts to convince partners not to support the union had backfired and was the reason the vote was so one-sided.\n\n\"I'm not surprised by the margin. We've been fighting this for so many months,\" said Taylor Brennan, another one of the Mesa partners. \"It wasn't one person who got screwed over.\"\n\nStarbucks says it has better pay and benefits than many of its competitors, including health care coverage for part-time workers and college tuition reimbursement. It has issued two wage increases in the last 18 months, and in October, the company said it would raise wages to at least $15 an hour for baristas, with most hourly employees earning an average of nearly $17 an hour by the summer. And it says it has the best retention rate in the industry.\n\nBut besides better pay, those supporting the organizing effort say they want more input over how work is performed in stores. For example, workers walked off the job at the first unionized store in Buffalo for about a week in January to voice concern about safety measures in the face of the Omicron surge.\n\nAlthough many of the stores the union has filed to represent are in states with strong pro-labor histories, including Michigan, New York, California and Starbucks' home state of Washington, elections will also be held at locations in states with low unionization rates, such as Tennessee, Texas, Georgia as well as Arizona.\n\nThose who study labor movements say this is already a significant union effort given the difficulty that labor has organizing new businesses, especially at restaurants and bars.\n\nData from the Labor Department shows that only 1.2% of workers in the sector are union members, tying with finance and professional and technical services for the lowest share of union membership of any sector tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nUnions are working diligently to reverse decades of declining power in the United States. To accomplish that, organizing new members and new industries will be crucial.\n\nWhile nearly 34% of government workers are represented by unions, only 6% of the more than 116 million workers at private sector US businesses were union members last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The overall percentage of unionized workers stands at 10.2% and has been steadily declining for nearly 40 years, down from 16.8% in 1983, the first year it was calculated by BLS.\n\n\"I think it is significant already. We haven't seen this scale of organizing in these kinds of establishments before,\" said Alexander Colvin, professor of labor relations at Cornell University.\n\nThe fact that the union has filed for so many additional elections in the wake of its first win shows the potential for that organizing effort to grow, and the importance that a win in Mesa could have, said Todd Vachon, an assistant professor and director of labor education at Rutgers University.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misidentified the company that says it has better pay and benefits than many of its competitors.", "source":{"uri":"edition.cnn.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"CNN International"}, "authors":[{"uri":"chris_isidore@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Chris Isidore", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/media.cnn.com\/api\/v1\/images\/stellar\/prod\/220225175625-restricted-starbucks-unionizing-mesa-az.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "eventUri":"eng-8102941", "sentiment":0.4588235294117646, "wgt":403544760, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7226284185", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2022-10-15", "time":"15:46:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-15T15:46:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T15:45:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.5529412031173706, "url":"http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2022\/08\/17\/tech\/amazon-union-vote\/index.html", "title":"Workers file for union vote at another Amazon facility | CNN Business", "body":"New York CNN Business --\n\nThe union that was the first to win a representation vote at an Amazon facility has filed for an election among about 400 employees at another Amazon distribution center.\n\nThe facility is in suburban Albany, New York. The National Labor Relations Board, which oversees union representation votes, has confirmed the filing but has yet to verify the signatures of the employees who signed cards asking for the vote. At least 30% of the employees in a potential bargaining unit need to sign cards for an election to be held.\n\n\"We're proud and happy for these workers to be standing up and fighting for their rights,\" said Chris Smalls, president of the Amazon Labor Union, which won the vote at an Amazon facility on Staten Island, New York, in April, but lost the vote at a second nearby facility in May.\n\nSmalls said he is talking to employees who are working to hold elections at other facilities across the country, although he wouldn't say how many organizing campaigns are underway.\n\n\"There will be plenty more to come after that in short order.

November will show whether they can do it again | CNN Politics", "body":"CNN --\n\nKansas Gov. Laura Kelly is petite, soft-spoken and rarely heard from on the national stage. But on August 2, when Kansans shocked the nation by voting to preserve a right to abortion in the state's constitution, Kelly's statement on the vote read like a new blueprint for Democrats navigating the uncertain politics of the post Roe v. Wade era.\n\n\"Kansans stood up for fundamental rights today,\" Kelly wrote in a tweet. \"We rejected divisive legislation that jeopardized our economic future & put women's health care access at risk.\"\n\nAnother tweet called proponents of the ballot measure \"extremists\" and warned that \"they want to take our state back in time.\"\n\nAll of this in a state that Donald Trump won by double digits. Twice.\n\nKelly, who made national headlines when she was elected to office in 2018, is one of this year's most vulnerable Democratic incumbents as she fights for a second term in her reliably red state.\n\nDespite her full-throated opposition to the ballot measure that would have allowed lawmakers to strip abortion rights from the state's constitution, and her long history of pushing back on abortion restrictions both as governor and during her 14 years as a state legislator, Kelly is very much not centering her campaign on abortion.\n\n\"The vote on August 2 made it very clear how that can be, that Kansans tend to elect to the governor's office a very moderate, commonsense, thoughtful person to run their state and to make sure that the basic services are provided for them,\" Kelly said in an interview. \"What they want me as governor to do is to focus on the kitchen table issues. You know, they want me to focus on the economy. And we have done that.\"\n\nVoters, Democratic candidates and organizers say the issue of abortion has emerged as a source of debate and conversation among voters here, particularly after the referendum. And while the economy is still the top issue, abortion often emerges as a concern.\n\nThat said, Kelly is fighting for political survival in an unusual landscape: one in which economic headwinds and political polarization would seem to make it more difficult for any Democrat in a purple or red state to survive. But it is also one in which a burst of energy, prompted by the Supreme Court's reversal of 50 years of legal precedent on abortion, has given Democrats a fresh opportunity.\n\nKelly has opted to plant her reelection campaign firmly in home-grown Kansas issues: eliminating a grocery tax, funding for schools and her fiscal stewardship of the state.\n\nIt's a strategy designed to counter the efforts by her Republican opponent, state Attorney General Derek Schmidt, to tie her to national Democratic figures like President Joe Biden and US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as well as national issues like immigration, inflation and culture-war issues.\n\nA recent Schmidt ad accused Kelly of supporting \"groups that push critical race theory and the transgender agenda.\n\n\"Laura Kelly won't stand up to the liberal Washington agenda. But I will,\" Schmidt says in the ad.\n\nIn Kansas, registered Republicans outnumber Democrats nearly 2 to 1. And if Kelly is going to replicate the coalition that won her the governor's mansion in 2018, she will both have to maximize Democratic voters and recruit some moderate Republican voters.\n\n\"As a Democrat, you have to have Republican support to win in Kansas, whether statewide or in some of these targeted congressional districts,\" said Tom Bonier, CEO of TargetSmart, a Democratic research firm. \"Republicans make up a majority of the electorate in the state. And so we've seen in the vote on that constitutional amendment in August that a large number of Republicans actually supported the 'no vote' - the pro-[abortion rights] position.\"\n\nAbortion rights remains on voters' minds\n\nOn the ground in Kansas, a familiar story is playing out: The economy is voters' top concern.\n\nBut after the August referendum, where nearly 60% of Kansans voted to protect abortion access, that issue is still on voters' minds.\n\nBoth Kelly and Schmidt have been pressed in recent debates on their positions on abortion.\n\nKelly firmly, but succinctly reiterated her position on abortion, framing it as a form of government overreach into women's bodily autonomy.\n\n\"I think 60% of Kansas said they don't want that government overreach into people's personal lives,\" Kelly said at the Kansas State Fair on September 10, to applause from supporters. \"I have been consistent on my position on this issue since I entered the state Senate 18 years ago. And I will stay consistent, no matter what.\n\nSchmidt has said that the voters' will should be respected, but that the issue is not settled.\n\n\"I do believe that going forward the biggest challenge will be defending those restrictions and limitations that are already on the books,\" Schmidt said. \"I believe they will be subject to legal challenge, I'm committed to defending them going forward.\"\n\nIf anything, the results of the ballot initiative have scrambled perceptions in Kansas of whether abortion is an issue that Democrats can use to win over moderate Republican voters.\n\nRetirees Linda and Jim Schottler are registered Republicans in Manhattan, Kansas, who say the abortion referendum changed the way people talk about the issue - and politics in general - in the state.\n\n\"A lot of people just don't talk politics when they get into a group because they are afraid of stepping on toes,\" Jim Schottler said. \"But since the referendum, I feel like a lot of people are talking about that and maybe trying to loosen the conversation about that polarization.\"d\n\nBut when it comes to national politics and the economy, their mood is far more ambivalent.\n\n\"I'm not sure I agree with Biden on a lot of issues, but I don't agree with the opposite party right now. So it's a difficult situation,\" Linda Schottler said.\n\nYet the couple voted no on the abortion ballot measure and plan to support Kelly in November.\n\n\"We voted no, believing that a woman's right to her own body should be her decision, not someone else's,\" Linda Schottler said.\n\n\"It was just not our right to decide for somebody else,\" Jim Schottler.\n\nAmyJo Kneisel, a Kansas native who recently moved back to the state, says she intends to reregister as a Republican ahead of the general election. Her younger sister, Angela Dawdy, is a Democrat. Despite their opposite political affiliations, abortion access is where they find common ground.\n\n\"I myself have an 11-year-old daughter and I want her to be able to have choices in life. And that's a huge choice for me,\" Dawdy said. \"I just hope that going forward that people make choices based more on the ideology of what's out there, not just Republican or Democrat.\n\n\"I've never been a proponent for abortion, but then again, what's right for me may not be right for somebody else,\" Kneisel said. \"Well, don't tell our dad this, but I might end voting a little bit more Democrat based on what's been going on with the party lately.\"\n\n\"We like to weigh both issues with both parties. So, we don't just go in and blindly vote based on our party. We listen and keep our ear to the ground,\" added Kneisel.\n\n'Kansas was the first indicator'\n\nKelly and Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids, who is running for reelection in Kansas' 3rd Congressional district, are hoping to find many more Republican voters exactly like the Schottlers and Kneisel. In 2020, Davids won her district by a 10-point margin against Republican Amanda Adkins, who is running against her again this cycle.\n\nBut after redistricting, Kansas' 3rd District may be a steeper hill for Davids to climb with the addition of rural and conservative communities. And yet, she says, voters are still raising the issue of reproductive rights with her in conversation.\n\n\"I talk about and address and try to work on issues that people are talking to me about,\" Davids said in an interview. \"I've met with folks who... the purpose of the meeting was to talk about farm bill issues. And then at the end of the meeting, I've had folks say, hey, where are you at on the constitutional amendment.\"\n\n\"People get really emotional when they tell me about this stuff and that they want to make sure that someone like me or some governor or some other politician isn't the one who's telling somebody whether or not they can get access to the care that they need in an emergency situation,\" she added.\n\nThe referendum has also made Democrats in the state more bullish on the prospect of bringing new voters into the electorate - especially young women and voters of color.\n\n\"I think there was a big question as to what impact [the Supreme Court abortion decision] would have on the election and on the November election,\" said Bonier. \"And so Kansas was the first indicator in seeing that women, younger voters, and voters of color were so engaged in that election and turned out at such a high rate.\n\n\"It proves that that issue is something that can motivate these voters to come out in this election that really looked like it was going to be a definitive red wave election.\"\n\nDemocratic organizers like 27-year-old Carla Rivas-D'Amico of Common Sense Kansas have set their sights on the state's Latino community, which accounts for 13% of the state's population and is the fastest growing minority population in Kansas.\n\nIn the August primary, the share of the Latino vote was the second highest in Kansas history, narrowly ahead of their share of the electorate in the 2018 general election, according to the data firm Catalist.\n\n\"The voters sent a really clear message that they want politicians to stay out of their private medical decisions and instead focus on creating jobs, strengthening the economy, and funding our schools,\" said Rivas-D'Amico.\n\nJust before dusk in a strip mall in Olathe, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City, Rivas-D'Amico, whose parents are from Venezuela, gave a training session in Spanish to about 20 Hispanic volunteers who were preparing to canvas in the area. More than one out of every 10 residents in Olathe is Hispanic. She teared up as she described the importance of building the community's political power.\n\n\"We deserve to be persuaded,\" Rivas-D'Amico said.\n\nLater, as she walked the streets of a predominantly working-class Latino neighborhood, Rivas-D'Amico said that voters here talk to her overwhelmingly about the economy, but among organizers, there's newfound encouragement that if they go after these votes, it could make a difference.\n\n\"This is one of the most competitive governor's races and congressional races in the country and every vote makes the difference,\" she said. \"The overwhelming 60% win was unexpected to a lot of people but it restored confidence in the idea that when we get out there and we organize, we talk to each other - which is the only way forward - we win.\"", "source":{"uri":"edition.cnn.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"CNN International"}, "authors":[{"uri":"abby_phillip@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Abby Phillip", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/media.cnn.com\/api\/v1\/images\/stellar\/prod\/221014204007-01-laura-kelly-072722-restricted.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":-0.05098039215686279, "wgt":403544460, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7226280619", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":true, "date":"2022-10-15", "time":"15:40:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-15T15:40:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T15:40:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2022\/10\/14\/tech\/apple-store-union-oklahoma\/", "title":"Workers at second Apple store vote to join union | CNN Business", "body":"CNN Business --\n\nApple workers in Oklahoma City have voted to form the second-ever labor union at one of the company's US stores, in the latest sign that organizing efforts are gaining traction inside and outside the tech and retail industries.\n\nIn a preliminary tally by the National Labor Relations Board on Friday evening, 56 workers, or 64% of those casting ballots at the Penn Square Mall Apple store, voted to be represented the Communication Workers of America, and 32 voted against it. Turnout was strong, with 88 of a potential 95 workers participating in the vote.\n\nThe union victory comes four months after Apple store workers in Towson, Maryland, made history by voting to form Apple's first US unionized location. In late June, the NLRB officially certified the union election win.\n\nWorkers at both locations have said they're looking to unionize in an effort to have more of a say in how their stores are run. Some also said they were inspired by union pushes this year at Amazon and Starbucks.\n\nApple did not directly address the vote results when asked for comment Friday.\n\n\"We believe the open, direct and collaborative relationship we have with our valued team members is the best way to provide an excellent experience for our customers, and for our teams,\" said the company's statement. \"We're proud to provide our team members with strong compensation and exceptional benefits. Since 2018, we've increased our starting rates in the US by 45% and we've made many significant enhancements to our industry-leading benefits.\"\n\nThe vote was roughly in line with what employees leading the organizing effort were expecting, according to Leigha Briscoe, one of the members of the organizing committee at the store.\n\n\"We felt like we had the majority support, and as long a people got out and cast their vote, we would win,\" Briscoe told CNN Business late Friday after the vote tally.\n\nBriscoe has been an employee at the store for six years. She said the employees who wanted to form a union approached CWA, rather than CWA trying to organize the store on its own.\n\nBriscoe, 28, is typical of many of the younger workers leading successful union organizing drives nationwide in the wake of the pandemic. Many of the successful efforts, such as at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island, New York, and at more than 200 Starbucks stores nationwide, have been led by workers in their twenties or early thirties.\n\nBetween January and July of this year there were 826 union elections, up 45% from the number held in the same period of 2021, according to a CNN analysis of data from the NLRB. And the 70% success rate by unions in those votes is far better than the 42% success rate in the first seven months of 2021.\n\nBut only 41,000 potential union members were eligible to vote in the 2022 elections. Even if the unions had won all those votes -- NLRB data don't break down how many workers worked at each company holding a vote -- it would be a small fraction of the more than 100 million workers at US businesses who don't belong to a union, according to Labor Department statistics.\n\nThe retail sector has a far lower rate of unionization than some other industries. Labor Department data show only 4.4% of retail workers nationwide are members of unions, compared to 6.1% of employees working at businesses overall.\n\nWhen including government employees, only 10.3% of workers nationwide are union members, roughly half the rate of union membership in 1983, the first year it was tracked by the Labor Department, when union membership made up 20.1% of the nation's workers.\n\nOklahoma is not particularly fertile ground for union efforts.

She is the only trusted leader in this race bringing forward real plans that will deliver results.\"\n\nDrazan defended the rationale for the walkout at the time, saying it was not the time for cap-and-trade policies \"because we cannot prevent these costs from being passed on - not to big companies, not utilities - but just straight down the line to Oregonians.\"\n\n\"Homelessness, crime, affordability, and education all dramatically worsened during her time in power,\" Drazan campaign spokesperson John Burke said of Kotek. \"Oregonians have had enough of her excuses and her failed agenda. That's why they're going to elect Christine Drazan as their next governor.\"", "source":{"uri":"edition.cnn.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"CNN International"}, "authors":[{"uri":"maeve_reston@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Maeve Reston", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/media.cnn.com\/api\/v1\/images\/stellar\/prod\/221014232944-101522-oregon-gov-kotek-johnson-drazan-split.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":-0.08235294117647063, "wgt":403540860, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7226191099", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2022-10-15", "time":"13:53:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-15T13:53:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T13:52:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/interactive\/2022\/10\/us\/inmate-woman-friendship-undivided-cec\/index.html", "title":"A Seattle woman formed an unlikely friendship with a California prison inmate convicted of murder. It's changed both their lives", "body":"(CNN) -- Ann Patnaude is a soft-spoken White woman with a doctorate in art history. The 47-year-old lives in Seattle with her husband of two decades and their Black lab, Zoe.\n\nRichard Lathan is a Black former gang member and an inmate at a prison in Southern California, where he is serving 15 years to life for murder.\n\nOn the surface, the two might seem like they have nothing in common.\n\nAnd yet over the past three years they have forged a deep friendship that defies their cultural differences and the prison walls that separate them.\n\nThe pair have never met in person. But they write letters to each other, talk on the phone several times a week and have seen each other through a pandemic and bouts of sickness -- Lathan's coronavirus and Patnaude's fight with multiple myeloma.\n\nAnn's husband, John Patnaude, marvels at their close friendship.\n\n\"I was a little cautious at first.\" he says. \"But through his letters to Ann, I have gotten to know Richard, which really changed my view of the whole situation. His letters reflect someone who's completely different from the person he was when he first went to prison.\"\n\nRichard has been behind bars for 31 years -- most of his adult life, and most of it at California's notorious San Quentin State Prison. He admits he committed a lot of crimes as a gang member, but maintains he has never killed anyone and was wrongly convicted of murder.\n\nHe got a glimmer of hope last year when he learned a former police detective involved in his case is under review over possible misconduct for allegedly using the n-word to describe suspects -- a bombshell that could potentially win him a new trial. Richard was recently transferred to the California Institution for Men in Chino as he awaits a parole hearing in November.\n\nTheir paths would likely have never crossed if Ann hadn't heard Richard interviewed five years ago this month on a podcast. At the time she volunteered at a hospital, providing companionship to terminally ill patients.\n\nThis is the story, in their own words, of two people from different worlds brought together by compassion, curiosity and a desire to connect. Richard's account came from numerous phone calls with CNN from prison. Their words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nANN PATNAUDE: In October 2017, I was listening to a podcast about prison life. Richard came on to talk about his work as a volunteer with the gold coats, a sort of prison nurse's aide. He shared how his work involves helping sick people who need to go to the infirmary. Or if someone's had an accident or needs help changing a colostomy bag or anything like that, he is right there to help. He spoke with such passion, empathy and compassion about what he did. For whatever reason, that story stayed with me for a while. I wrote him a letter and and sat on it for months because I didn't know how to reach out. I'm a stranger and it felt a little bit like fan mail. I finally mailed it in August 2019.\n\nDear Mr. Lathan,\n\nI heard your story ... and wanted to contact you. I was moved deeply by your work as a gold coat. It takes a compassionate personality to care for those who are ill, and I related to your story because I volunteer at a local hospital in Seattle ...\n\nRICHARD LATHAN: I was surprised when I got the letter. I'm 53 -- I've been in prison since I was 21. Never in my wildest dreams did I think anyone would be interested in my life or my work. I wrote back, but I did not expect to get a response.\n\nDear Ms. Patnaude,\n\nI have read your letter several times over and yes, I cried because it feels so good to get acknowledged for the good things that I do. Your letter is so beautiful. I have shown it to quite a few people ....\n\nANN: At the hospital, sometimes I'd sit with patients who were dying and wanted companionship but didn't necessarily have someone to be with them. With both of us volunteering in those capacities, I felt like we could connect over that. In the podcast, Richard said he felt like he'd taken so much in life and this was his way of giving back. And I said, you know, I hope that you can find true compassion and forgiveness for yourself. And that struck up a conversation. One of the things I love about him is he's very emotional, he's OK to cry ... I call him a big softie. He was just willing to express himself and be open. And we just started talking through letters.\n\nDear Mr. Lathan,\n\nMay I call you Richard? I was surprised and delighted by your letter. You may hear this often, but your handwriting is so lovely. When I first saw the envelope in the mail, I thought I was being invited to a fancy party. :-) But, even better, it was a letter from you ... Little did I know, I was being invited into a wonderful friendship.\n\nRICHARD: Every time I wrote back, I did not expect to get a response. At the time, my work as a gold coat involved stuff such as cleaning up blood, crime scenes, helping elderly people care for their scabs, removing lice, everything. Our jobs were different but similar. But I kept asking myself, I'm I worthy of having a friend like her? Never. Because I'm a man in prison that she didn't know. I'm a criminal. I was surprised that she kept writing. At first, I didn't know how to respond ... but I tried to respond within the boundaries of respect. The same compassion she showed me, I tried to show it to her.\n\nDear Ms. Patnaude,\n\nYes, you may call me Richard. I am so happy that my letter has caught you in a good mood. You are very much invited to a fancy party as long as you are smiling and having a good time ... Sorry it took so long for me to respond. Please continue to write.\n\nANN: Richard is a beautiful writer. He has a really high emotional intelligence and he's not afraid to express his gratitude. Or when he talks about the work he does as a gold coat, he will say extraordinary things like being of service to people is what makes his life worth living. When we started getting to know each other, I would ask him questions like, what's your favorite movie? Or, what kind of music do you listen to? And what do you do with your time when you're not helping people?\n\nThen we decided to start talking on the phone. I set up a prepaid phone for that -- you put money on your phone through this system and then you give him your number and when he calls, I pay for the calls that I receive from him. These are all things I've had to learn. It's so frustrating because if you miss a call, you can't just text or say, I'll call you right back. I have a special ring for his calls -- a ringtone called Sencha. Sometimes, you go through long periods where you haven't heard anything. It can be stressful because you feel concerned for your friend.\n\nDear Mr. Lathan,\n\nMay I ask you a question? You do not have to answer. I'm curious, knowing what you know now, what advice would you give your younger self? Forgive me if that is too personal. Please do not feel obligated to respond.\n\nRICHARD: The best way I can describe getting her letters and talking to her on the phone is like being a fat kid in a candy store. We've talked about everything ... what music I listen to on my CD player -- Luther Vandross, Andrea Bocelli -- something soothing, somber, nothing with racial undertones. We talked about movies, like \"The Preacher's Wife\" with my favorite actor, Denzel Washington.\n\nMy journalism and screenwriting classes, public speaking, my poetry. We even talk about health issues -- my seizures and anxiety, which I take medication for. She also told me that she was dealing with multiple myeloma. I looked it up in the library and saw it's some kind of cancer. I'm getting emotional now just talking about it. I wish I can bring her peace. I wish I can help her in some kind of way. One time she was sick and I couldn't reach her. I cried that day, I couldn't go to sleep.\n\nDear Ms. Patnaude,\n\nYou can ask me any question that you want and I will answer them, all of them. ... Knowing what I know now, the advice that I would give to my younger self is to always ask questions about manhood, womanhood, life ... because your belief system will constantly change. Also go to someone that you believe truly has your best interest at heart.\n\nANN: We've had conversations about dating, and how he should treat women. Race in the US. We've talked about White space, White power, White supremacy, White privilege, White silence, what it means to be a Black man in America. Who has access to things and who doesn't. We have discussed anti-Asian racism and violence. What stands out for me in all of these conversations is Richard's empathy. He has an ability to see how all sides are interconnected and that we truly need one another. Richard has a deep desire for truth and reconciliation, wanting to know when we can get to a point in society where we can stop harming each other. Richard also has a desire to be the change he wants to see in the world, and believes that change begins with the self.\n\nRICHARD: I ask her questions about women, because I was never taught how to be a man. I used to think being with a woman was the graduation of manhood -- it took prison for me to know that's not true. She's taught me as our friendship moved forward that it has nothing to do with that. I didn't know her race when we started exchanging letters. I did not know that she was White until months later, when she sent me a photo of her family. By then it was too late -- we were already friends. But that's never been an issue. The color lines may be drawn outside, but that stuff is not in the way. I can't fathom not being her friend over that.\n\nDear Ann,\n\nWe may have our differences because of what we have inherited from our ancestors ... but we as humans don't have to adhere to the illness that splits our souls dramatically without knowing why. Color cannot be the only reason for our division.\n\nANN: One of the things I've always appreciated about our friendship is his realness. I like that he's willing to be open and vulnerable and honest. When we're on the outside in society and culture ... we're not always like that with each other.\n\nRICHARD: I had no idea that a stranger would become like a mother figure to me. She has an unbelievable courage about her. At times, she had me crying that a person like me would have this type of friendship. I grew up on the streets. My mother kicked me out when I was 17. I told myself, if my mother doesn't care about me and I don't see my father, why should I care about anyone else? I grew up fighting the world ... my heart was frozen. I didn't understand anything beyond survival, shootouts, drugs, smoking weed, robbing and things of that nature. And the more we talked, I could feel the onion peel, my heart opening, the ice starting to melt.\n\nIn my mind, I thought I'd have to battle the world by myself. And she gave me this gift. It's very astonishing, this friendship. I don't know what I did to deserve it.\n\nI pray for her every single day. She chose to be my friend, with no clauses. That's unconditional love. She does not look at me as a prisoner. Or someone who was in the gang. She looks at me like a human being. My mother died while I was in prison. I feel like Ann's son from a different life. I've never had friends like her. That's what I have been looking for my whole life, that's what I needed. And I don't have to battle for it like in my past life.\n\nANN: John is equally as invested in this friendship. Sometimes, my ringtone will go off, and my husband and I will both rush to the phone so we don't miss the call. If Richard doesn't communicate for a while, sometimes John will say, have you heard from him recently? During football season Richard will ask, who is John rooting for right now? And when Richard writes, he always says give John and Zoe big hugs.\n\nRICHARD: John and Ann -- I don't see my life without them. They've become my family. They took me as I am. No ifs, buts, you gotta change this. They see me for who I am. Sometimes I ask Ann to tell me if I'm I butting in. I don't want to disrespect her or John because she is married. And she will tell me if I was butting in, she would not answer the phone.\n\nI've never had this kind of friendship. I didn't trust nobody, I didn't know how to. I lived on the streets of LA, slept on a crate. I sold drugs. Heroin, crack, weed. It's taken a while to get here. Self-help classes, some of which have turned out to be therapy classes. By the time you leave the class you're either crying or walking with your head up. You're in there with total strangers. The only thing you have in common is you committed the same crime or you're in prison. Through all the work, I'm learning to forgive myself and open up to others. I'm learning to ask for forgiveness.\n\nANN: Richard has taught me what it means to have grace and equanimity no matter the circumstances. He has taught me what it looks like to face each day, each hardship, each setback, with good humor, dignity and honesty. He has shown me that there is strength in vulnerability. He tells me when he was a young man, he was a very angry person. And how he's overcome that in himself and doesn't let that take up space in his brain. And he has this way of moving through the world and seeing the world that I certainly admire. He gives me such a perspective of inside, outside, male, female, Black, White.\n\nRICHARD: Our friendship has taught me how to ground myself. How to be balanced. How to have courage. How to speak with manners, instead of being an ... excuse my French ... a-hole. She has a motherly way that's strong but easy, and it gives me a lot of confidence. She'll let me know that something ain't right and I should try to approach it in a different way. I never learned simple things like manners, or women and dating, before I came to prison. I can ask her anything, and she will answer it in the best way she can.\n\nI never killed anyone. But sometimes I feel like they threw me in prison to pay for all the other things that I did. Ann once asked me if I've forgiven myself. That question blew me away. I made a promise to myself that I would never leave prison the way I came -- angry, outlandish, defiant. Once you establish forgiveness, everything else comes from the heart.", "source":{"uri":"edition.cnn.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"CNN International"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/cdn.cnn.com\/cnnnext\/dam\/assets\/221003115146-07-inmate-woman-friendship-undivided-full-169.jpg", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":-0.02745098039215688, "wgt":403537980, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7226191103", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2022-10-15", "time":"13:53:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-15T13:53:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T12:57:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2022\/10\/15\/us\/susan-g-komen-breast-cancer-awareness-month-wellness-cec\/index.html", "title":"How Susan G. Komen became such a recognized name in breast cancer awareness | CNN", "body":"Survivors and supporters cheer on the runners at the start a Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event in Savannah, Georgia in 2012.\n\nSusan G. Komen is one of the largest, most recognized breast cancer organizations in the world. Since its founding in 1982, the nonprofit has invested more than $1 billion in cancer research, and more than $2 billion in patient outreach, according to financial documents. The foundation's Race for the Cure is known as the one of the largest breast cancer awareness events created, and is as synonymous with the cause as the iconic pink ribbon.\n\nYet, the actual Susan G. Komen was not a celebrity. She did not publicize her illness, which took her life in 1980 at the age of 36. In fact, it was only after Komen's death that her name became so incredibly famous.\n\nWho was Susan G. Komen?\n\nSusan G. Komen was born Susan Goodman, and grew up in Peoria, Illinois. According to her sister, Nancy Goodman Brinker, she was well-liked; a homecoming queen and caring older sister. When Komen was diagnosed with breast cancer at 33, she and her family went through all of the terror and uncertainty one does when faced with a life-threatening disease. Despite undergoing various treatment strategies, Komen died three years later.\n\nIt was Nancy Brinker who founded the organization in Komen's honor. Brinker, who was married to restaurant magnate Norman Brinker until 2000, would go on to become the World Health Organization's Goodwill Ambassador for Cancer Control. She was also awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama in 2009.\n\nNancy Brinker in 2018. Brinker, Susan G. Komen's sister, founded the charity in her memory. Allen Eyestone\/Daily News\/USA Today Network How did Susan G. Komen get so popular?\n\nIn 1983, Brinker had the idea to capitalize on the jogging fad and hold a 5K race in Dallas as a fundraising event. The result was the first ever Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure. The idea ballooned from there, becoming a multi-city event within years. This level of marketing savvy was one of the reasons the foundation got so popular so quickly. The pageantry of the races, with survivors and supporters decked out in pink, carrying signs and cheering each other on along the way, became an iconic part of the breast cancer awareness movement.\n\nBrinker's charity efforts were also buoyed by a rising tide of breast cancer awareness in the 1980s. First lady Betty Ford, wife of President Gerald Ford, prompted an increase in mammograms back in 1974 after she announced she had breast cancer. Brinker herself was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1984.\n\nSusan G. Komen continued to harness the momentum of breast cancer awareness into the 1990s, as the popularity of the ubiquitous pink ribbon also rose and more companies began creating breast cancer awareness tie-ins. By its 20th anniversary in 2002, the foundation had raised more than $400 million and amassed powerful corporate partners.\n\nHowever, the foundation has also been beset by controversy. In 2012, Susan G. Komen halted funding for screening exams for Planned Parenthood, a move many saw as a politicization of the cause. Though the decision was reversed, it caused the resignation of several staff members and damaged public perception. Around the same time, Brinker - who stepped down as CEO - was criticized for the large six-figure salary she was collecting as CEO of the foundation. In 2016, the foundation received more criticism after holding an annual fundraiser at then-presidential candidate Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club.\n\nSince these events, the organization has struggled with wavering levels of public trust, even seeing a decline in fundraising in recent years.\n\nDespite controversy, Komen's Race for the Cure walks and runs continue to be wildly popular. This year, 40 cities across the US will host More Than Pink Walk and Race for the Cure events. And while not every pink ribbon or breast cancer walk is related to Susan G. Komen, the foundation's influence is hard to overlook.", "source":{"uri":"edition.cnn.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"CNN International"}, "authors":[{"uri":"aj_willingham@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Aj Willingham", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/media.cnn.com\/api\/v1\/images\/stellar\/prod\/221012101036-01-breast-cancer-awareness-komen.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":-0.08235294117647063, "wgt":403537980, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7226190603", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2022-10-15", "time":"13:52:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-15T13:52:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T13:52:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2022\/10\/15\/entertainment\/big-shot-john-stamos-disney-plc\/index.html", "title":"'Big Shot' new season finds the ball back in John Stamos' court | CNN", "body":"John Stamos stars as high school girls basketball coach Marvyn Korn in \"Big Shot\" on Disney+.\n\nA version of this story appeared in Pop Life Chronicles, CNN's weekly entertainment newsletter.

CNN\n\nBy now, you've probably heard the story of comedian Ariel Elias getting a beer can lobbed at her while performing onstage. What played out is a reminder that, despite how uncivil our society has become, it's all about how you handle what life throws your way.\n\nElias was doing stand-up recently at Uncle Vinnie's Comedy Club in Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey, when an audience member began grilling her on whether she had voted for President Joe Biden.\n\n\"I wasn't talking about politics,\" Elias told CNN. \"It just felt like she was looking for a fight.\"\n\nThe heckler was tossed out of the club, but the man who was seated next to her threw a beer can at Elias. It landed hard on a wall near to where she was performing.\n\nRather than explode or turn the other cheek, Elias just took a sip of the remaining brew. That reaction, and determination to finish her set, has won her praise from all over.\n\nSomething to sip on Madonna shared a TikTok video that has stirred debate among some of her followers.\n\nLet me first preface what I am about to say by stating I am a longtime admirer of Madonna.\n\nThe singer had quite a few people talking this week when she shared a TikTok video that had some thinking she was coming out as gay.\n\nOthers complained that the star, who has always been a huge supporter of LGBTQ rights, was \"queer-baiting,\" alongside broader criticism about Madonna taking to TikTok at her age.\n\nMadonna is not a fan of people pointing out her age (see her taking the New York Times Magazine to task in 2019), and the entertainment industry is notorious for ageism.\n\nYet it can be difficult for older celebrities to strike a tone on social media that feels appropriate. Some of them, like Dionne Warwick on Twitter, have mastered it -- others can come across as cringe.\n\nNot that Madonna has to fade away -- I doubt she ever could -- but she'll likely always be judged by some, as her determination to live life on her own terms is ageless.\n\nWhat did you like about today's newsletter?

The United Nations released a grim report on Friday accusing the country's powerful gangs of using rape as a tool of intimidation and control.\n\nOn Sunday, UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres called for support to the Haitian National Police, after the country had requested such outside help.\n\nPort-au-Prince was the site of brutal gang battles this summer that saw whole neighborhoods set aflame, displacing thousands of families and trapping others in their homes, afraid to leave even in search of food and water.\n\nHundreds were left dead, injured or missing. Criminals still control or influence parts of the country's most populous city, and kidnappings for ransom threaten residents' day-to-day movements. In recent weeks, demonstrators in several cities called for Prime Minister Ariel Henry's resignation in the face of high fuel prices, soaring inflation and unchecked crime.\n\nTheir fury was further fueled last month when Henry announced that he would cut fuel subsidies in order to fund the government - a move that would double prices at the pump. Haiti's powerful gangs have exacerbated the fuel crisis by blocking the country's main port in Port-au-Prince.\n\nCNN's Caitlin Hu, Jennifer Hansler, Etant Dupain and Kaanita Iyer contributed to this report.", "source":{"uri":"edition.cnn.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"CNN International"}, "authors":[{"uri":"kylie_atwood@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Kylie Atwood", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/media.cnn.com\/api\/v1\/images\/stellar\/prod\/221005163513-01-haiti-protest-1003.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "eventUri":"eng-8096736", "sentiment":-0.1137254901960785, "wgt":403537860, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7226164097", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2022-10-15", "time":"13:21:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-15T13:21:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T13:09:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.6000000238418579, "url":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2022\/10\/15\/iran-and-eu-on-collision-course-over-sanctions-tied-with-protests", "title":"Iran and EU on collision course over sanctions tied with protests", "body":"Tehran, Iran - Iran and the European Union appear to be on a collision course over the bloc's preparation to impose sanctions aimed at punishing Tehran for its response to continuing protests.\n\nEuropean officials are reportedly ready to finalise human rights sanctions on Iranian officials and entities during an upcoming meeting of foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday.\n\nIran has clearly signalled that it will not sit idly by if the bloc joins the United States, Britain and Canada in imposing sanctions, with foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian warning several European foreign ministers of \"reciprocal action\" in phone calls this week.\n\n\"Some countries have considered riots and terrorist actions as protests in interventionist comments, which in effect incite rioters and terrorists,\" the Iranian diplomat told his Portuguese counterpart, Jo\u00e3o Gomes Cravinho, in his latest phone call late on Friday.\n\nUS outlet Politico reported earlier this week that Tehran has also privately warned the bloc, sending letters to EU ambassadors and foreign policy chief Josep Borrell to warn of the \"detrimental impact on Iran-Europe relations\" any sanctions would have.\n\nBut European officials appear unfazed as the French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, who also spoke with Amirabdollahian earlier this week, told French politicians the sanctions will move ahead \"despite the pressure exerted by Iran to cast our positions as interference\".\n\nThis comes as the EU has been mediating between Tehran and Washington in their efforts since April 2021 to restore the 2015 nuclear deal that the latter unilaterally abandoned in 2018. The talks have been in limbo with a lack of progress, approaching US mid-term elections and now protests in Iran making a breakthrough increasingly unlikely, at least in the short term.\n\nProtests gradually erupted across Iran after the September 16 death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who was arrested by Iran's morality police for wearing an improper hijab and died following a three-day coma after she suffered a heart attack in a police \"re-education\" centre in Tehran.\n\nThe medical examiner's final report, which has also been backed by the parliament, said she did not suffer any blows to the head or vital organs, and attributed Amini's death to conditions arising after a brain tumour surgery at age eight. Her family have said they suspect maltreatment in police custody.\n\nWestern officials and a number of human rights groups have condemned conditions surrounding Amini's death and the subsequent security forces' response to the protests.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday expressed \"admiration\" for women and youths demonstrating and condemned what he called \"repression\" by the authorities in comments that drew condemnation from the Iranian foreign ministry.\n\nUS President Joe Biden on Friday said he was \"stunned\" by the aftermath of Amini's death, saying, \"It's awakened something that I don't think will be quieted in a long, long time.\"\n\nBut speaking on Friday with the local and foreign guests of the Islamic Unity Conference in Tehran, Iran's Amirabdollahian asked, \"Who believes that the death of one girl is so important to the Westerners?\"\n\nIn addition to attributing the protests to foreign powers like the US and Israel, Iranian officials have also blamed \"terrorist\" separatist groups and anti-establishment media channels and people abroad.\n\nThe latest incident involving different narratives by media inside and outside of the country deals with school students, who have featured prominently in the protests and have been seen in videos taking off their hijabs and chanting slogans.\n\nForeign-based Persian media reported that a high school girl died during a protest in her school in northwestern Ardebil, and several students were arrested. Provincial officials told local media on Friday the \"fake and false\" news is propagated by anti-establishment media \"who have targeted the general and psychological security of the society\".\n\nThere have also been reports of students being arrested in other provinces, which authorities have denied.\n\nAmnesty International earlier this week published the names and pictures of 23 children that it said have been killed by security forces in Iran, a claim the authorities have yet to specifically address.\n\nBut officials have refuted that security forces have played any role in the deaths of two of the children named by Amnesty - 16 year olds Nika Shakarami and Sarina Esmailzadeh, details of whose deaths in Tehran and Karaj respectively were widely circulated and discussed on social media.\n\nMeanwhile, videos of protests continue to circulate on social media despite internet restrictions - mostly targeting mobile connectivity - that have lingered across the country.\n\nOn Saturday morning, amid calls on social media for nationwide protests 30 days after Amini's death, internet censorship observatory NetBlocks reported a new \"major disruption to internet traffic data\" across Iran.\n\nIndictments have already been issued for dozens of individuals accused of being \"leaders of riots\" in Tehran and other provinces, with judiciary chief Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei instructing judges to fast-track cases.", "source":{"uri":"aljazeera.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors":[{"uri":"maziar_motamedi@aljazeera.com", "name":"Maziar Motamedi", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/AP22062440417387.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440", "eventUri":"eng-8097365", "sentiment":-0.1529411764705882, "wgt":403536060, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7226161553", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2022-10-15", "time":"13:17:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-15T13:17:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T13:00:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.8313725590705872, "url":"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2022\/10\/15\/sport\/claressa-shields-savannah-marshall-fight-spt-intl\/index.html", "title":"'It's a war': Claressa Shields and Savannah Marshall's 10-year rivalry set to climax in historic fight | CNN", "body":"CNN --\n\nFace-to-face for the promotional photoshoot, and the fight between Britain's Savannah Marshall and the USA's Claressa Shields has already begun.\n\n\"I've got plenty of confidence,\" Shields taunted Marshall as the camera flashed, \"I came over here, come to America.\"\n\n\"No power though,\" Marshall retorted.\n\nThe two women, whose bitter rivalry stretches back 10 years, will face off for the undisputed middleweight championship on Saturday in London on a historic night for women's boxing, marking the first-ever all female card in the UK, as well the first time two women will headline at the O2 Arena.\n\nIt is the latest landmark during a historic year for the sport in which Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano became the first women to ever headline at Madison Square Gardens in May.\n\nWomen's boxing was banned in the UK as recently as 1998, and the rivalry between Marshall and Shields covers almost half the time in which the sport has been legal.\n\nIt began back at the 2012 AIBA world championship when Marshall emerged victorious on points, 14-8, inflicting the only defeat on Shields that she has ever suffered in her professional or amateur career.\n\nMarshall won that world championship a few days later while a then 17-year-old Shields won the Olympics a few months later.\n\nSavannah Marshall celebrates winning against Claressa Shields in 2012.

Moscow helped the Belarusian president quell pro-democracy protests that erupted following his victory in the disputed presidential election in 2020.\n\nThe Belarus leader allowed his country to be used by Moscow's troops to launch the invasion of Ukraine. But Belarusian armed forces have until now not taken part in the offensive.\n\nNow, the joint force's deployment raises fears that Belarusian troops could join Russian forces in their offensive in Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of \"trying to directly draw Belarus into this war\" at a G7 meeting on Tuesday, calling for an international observers' mission to be placed on the Ukraine-Belarus border.\n\nThe latest development comes as the Russian military offensive has witnessed a series of setbacks after losing ground in the northeast and south of Ukraine. In a further blow to Moscow last week, a huge explosion damaged the Kerch bridge linking annexed Crimea to mainland Russia. The damaged bridge - a key supply route for Russian soldiers - will not be repaired until July, a document published on the Russian government's website said. Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nRussia has carried out a barrage of missile and drone attacks across Ukraine after blaming Kyiv for the Kerch bridge blast. A hospital, a kindergarten and other buildings in the town of Nikopol, across the river from the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, were targeted.\n\nOn Friday, Putin said he has no plans \"for now\" to launch massive air raids such as those carried out on Monday. He added the call-up of reservists would be finished in two weeks, promising an end to the divisive mobilisation that has seen hundreds of thousands of men summoned to fight in Ukraine and huge numbers fleeing the country.\n\nSpeaking at a security summit in the Kazakh capital, Astana, Putin said he did not regret sending troops into Ukraine nearly eight months ago.\n\n\"What is happening today is unpleasant, to put it mildly,\" he said. \"But we would have had all this a little later, only under worse conditions for us, that's all.

Here's why it probably won't happen | CNN", "body":"CNN --\n\nKanye West has had so many controversies you may have forgotten a few.\n\nFrom his infamous interruption of Taylor Swift's acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards to his early embrace of former President Trump and his \"Make America Great Again\" agenda, the artist, designer and entrepreneur is, perhaps, best known for being a provocateur.\n\nThe latest calls to cancel West, who legally changed his name to Ye, may be the most intense yet.\n\nAfter he wore and featured \"White Lives Matter\" (The Anti-Defamation League categorizes the phrase as a \"hate slogan\" used by White supremacist groups, including the Ku Klux Klan) apparel in his recent Paris fashion show, there was new outcry against West.\n\n\"Kanye's actions are just so dangerous and irresponsible. I don't care how great his music is, we have to stop supporting someone who uses their platform so irresponsibly,\" TV host, professor and former CNN commentator Marc Lamont Hill posted on social media.\n\nAnother lightening rod came earlier this week, when West's Twitter and Instagram accounts were restricted for violating policies following posts that were criticized as antisemitic. Days later, it was announced that his episode of the YouTube series \"The Shop: Uninterrupted\" would not release because he used his appearance \"to reiterate more hate speech and very ugly stereotypes.\"\n\nThis has led some to suggest that West's career has crashed and burned and there's no coming back from it all. But here's why that's not necessarily the case:\n\nSign of the times\n\nFor all the talk of \"cancel culture,\" we now live in an era where bad behavior, especially by public figures, garners all of the outrage - until it doesn't.\n\nNot only do we live in a society that moves fairly quickly from scandal to scandal, racism and cruelty to others no longer live in the shadows.\n\nSo while plenty of people have condemned West for his actions and comments, there are many who support both because they agree with him.\n\nThen there is the fame factor.\n\nStar power has only increased in recent years, especially because social media fosters a sense of intimacy between artists and their followers.\n\n\"West's celebrity status has kept us watching and listening mostly because we're keenly aware that so many others are also paying attention,\" Washington Post senior critic-at-large Robin Givhan recently wrote.\n\n\"And each time he says something indecipherable or cruel, we recoil as if we are shocked anew, as if he has not been terrible before,\" she continued. \"We respond as if we believe that fame is a preventive to terrible behavior, that those who know they're being watched will aim to be on their best behavior rather than using all that attention as an enticement to acting out.\"\n\nThe Trump effect\n\nWest has been very clear about his admiration for Trump, and the two men do seem to share an approach to communication.\n\nWest recently said in an interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson that he \"started to really feel this need to express myself on another level when Trump was running for office and I liked him.\"\n\nWest said he was warned against supporting Trump, telling Carlson people told him \"my career would be over, my life would be over.\"\n\nInstead, West earned new fans from some of the same people who also support the former president.\n\nAfter conservative author and ACT! for America founder Brigitte Gabriel tweeted her support for West, one of her followers responded, \"I used to judge him quite harshly. I'm finding new respect for him now.\"\n\nThe art versus the artist\n\nIt's long been debated whether one can embrace the art without supporting the artist. West has a history of coming out on the winning side of that question.\n\nThere were calls to boycott West in 2018 after comments he made about the history of slavery in the United States.\n\n\"When you hear about slavery for 400 years,\" West said during an interview with TMZ. \"For 400 years? That sounds like a choice.\"\n\nYet, a month later, all seven tracks on his \"Ye\" album debuted on Billboard's Top 40 chart.\n\nThere have been several other controversies since that have not stopped West from achieving mass success with his fashion and sneaker lines.\n\nAnd while West terminated his relationship with the Gap in September, and Adidas has put their partnership with him under review, he entered the public consciousness nearly two decades ago through music that people will likely continue to return to.\n\nThe first words West speaks on his first hit, \"Through the Wire,\" in retrospect, may have been prescient: \"They can't stop me from rapping can they?\"", "source":{"uri":"edition.cnn.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"CNN International"}, "authors":[{"uri":"lisa_respers_france@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Lisa Respers France", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/media.cnn.com\/api\/v1\/images\/stellar\/prod\/221004160034-01-kanye-balenciaga.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":-0.3411764705882353, "wgt":403534740, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7226145528", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2022-10-15", "time":"12:58:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-15T12:58:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T12:10:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2022\/10\/15\/us\/syed-conviction-overturned-next\/index.html", "title":"In the wake of Adnan Syed's overturned murder conviction, many questions remain about the unsolved case | CNN", "body":"CNN --\n\nAfter Baltimore prosecutors decided this week to drop all charges against Adnan Syed, the man who spent more than two decades behind bars for the 1999 killing of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee, a key question remains: Who will be held accountable for Lee's death?\n\nSyed, who was 17 at the time of her death, was convicted in 2000 of first-degree murder, robbery, kidnapping and false imprisonment, and sentenced to life in prison. Yet he has long maintained his innocence, and his story was featured in the popular \"Serial\" podcast, which raised questions about the conviction and his legal representation.\n\nHe was freed from prison last month after prosecutors without warning moved to vacate his murder conviction, saying the state \"lacks confidence in the integrity of the conviction,\" but stopped short of declaring his innocence.\n\nBased on the prosecution's motion, a judge last month vacated the conviction and freed Syed, who walked out of the courthouse to cheers and applause from supporters.\n\nBaltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby said Tuesday she instructed her office to dismiss the charges after results of advanced DNA testing of Lee's shoes, skirt, pantyhose and jacket ruled out Syed.\n\n\"The items that we tested had never before been tested,\" Mosby said. \"We used advanced DNA to determine that it was not Adnan Syed.\"\n\nThe decision to drop charges comes about 23 years after the disappearance of Lee, Syed's ex-girlfriend and high school classmate. Her body was discovered in a city forest three weeks later. Authorities determined she had been strangled.\n\nTwo homicide detectives with the Baltimore Police Department are actively reinvestigating the case in partnership with Mosby's office, which is providing all the information about the case, as well as the new developments which came to light over the past year, Mosby told CNN Friday.\n\nIn September, prosecutors announced how a nearly yearlong investigation revealed evidence about the possible involvement of two suspects other than Syed, which prosecutors said was not properly turned over to defense attorneys.\n\nThe reinvestigation also raised questions about the reliability of cell phone data records, which were used to corroborate testimony of a witness who said he helped Syed dig a hole for the victim's body.\n\n\"Adnan was not viewed as a suspect. He was arrested approximately six weeks after Lee's disappearance,\" said Douglas Colbert, a law professor at the University of Maryland who served as one of Syed's first attorneys in the month after his arrest.\n\n\"New investigators will look at all the evidence with a fresh perspective, and undoubtedly will attempt to follow up on the information that was included in the Syed file,\" Colbert added.\n\nMosby said the purpose of the reinvestigation is to bring Lee's family \"some sort of closure and to see real justice,\" adding her office's responsibility is to deliver it to the victim, which in this case, are many - Syed and his family, as well as Lee and hers.\n\n\"I've been asked, 'Am I saying that he's innocent?' \" Mosby told CNN. \"The one thing that I will say is after an extensive review of all of the evidence that we just talked about, we do not have credible evidence that Mr. Syed is a responsible party in this event.\"\n\nWhat is the focus of the reinvestigation?\n\nThe path to Syed's release began in earnest last April, when attorneys for Syed brought the case to the attention of the Sentencing Review Unit. A recent piece of legislation allows people convicted of crimes as juveniles to ask for a modified sentence after they have served 20 years in prison, Mosby's office said.\n\nThe state attorney highlighted the flaws in Syed's case revealed in the review, including exculpatory evidence which was \"sat on for decades,\" about the possible involvement of two suspects other than Syed, including a person who said they would make Lee \"disappear\" and \"(h)e would kill her,\" prosecutors previously said.\n\nThe new evidence also showed one suspect was convicted of attacking a woman in her vehicle, according to the statement. A second suspect was convicted of engaging in serial rape and sexual assault, the statement said.\n\nSyed's attorneys said he and his legal team were unaware the information existed until this year.\n\nMoving forward, detectives will focus on looking for credible evidence to support any potential charges against any individual responsible for Lee's death, Mosby said, adding she could not provide any additional details about the ongoing investigation.\n\nDavid Jaros, professor of law at the University of Baltimore and faculty director at the Center for Criminal Justice Reform, said it's still unknown whether the DNA evidence examined in the review suggested one of the two suspects was involved in the death of Lee.\n\nThe case is a \"tragedy on both sides\" which began with the initial prosecution of Syed, Jaros said.\n\n\"Not only did the defendant unjustly spend 23 years in jail, but it is very difficult and unlikely that the family will ever see the actual perpetrator brought to justice,\" Jaros said, emphasizing it is difficult to investigate and bring to trial a case in which evidence is more than two decades old.\n\n\"It really does fundamentally challenge our notion about whether the criminal justice system is working in a way that we believe to be constitutional or that we're comfortable with,\" he said.\n\nDoes the victim's family have any recourse?\n\nSteve Kelly, the attorney for Lee's family, said the family learned about the dismissal of charges through the media and criticized the attorney's office for not notifying them beforehand.\n\n\"The family received no notice and their attorney was offered no opportunity to be present at the proceeding,\" Kelly said.\n\nYoung Lee, the victim's brother, said he felt \"betrayed\" by the state in his impact statement on a Zoom call during the Baltimore courthouse hearing in September.\n\n\"This isn't a podcast for me, it's real life,\" Lee said.\n\nMosby denied her office did not properly notify the Lee family, saying they were \"the first ones to receive a copy of the motion to vacate even before we filed it.\"\n\nJaros said the family's argument will be difficult to prove because the judge's decision was focused on the evidence not provided by the state to the defense, not a resentencing in which the court must consider a victim impact statement.\n\nMosby's subsequent decision to dismiss the charges has further complicated the family's options for recourse, he added.\n\nIn this case, Jaros said it is unlikely the family had a right to participate in the process, but they did still have a right to receive proper notice.\n\n\"The outstanding question is, did the state's attorney give the family reasonable notice that this process was happening when they found out just a few days before? And if they were successfully to argue it was not reasonable notice, does that mean the remedy is to do this over when there is no input needed from the victims?\" he added.\n\nWhat comes next for Syed?\n\nSyed is expected to follow a recertification process in order to be considered innocent in the case, Mosby said.\n\nHis legal team must file a request for compensation under Maryland's Walter Lomax Act, which was signed by Gov. Larry Hogan in 2021 to improve existing law on compensation for wrongfully convicted people.\n\nMosby's office will fully support Syed in any additional proceedings regarding his innocence, she said, and his case meets all the requirements to receive compensation.\n\nThe process under the Lomax Act requires the individual asking for compensation to demonstrate they were convicted and confined for a felony; the conviction was reversed or vacated; and the charges were dismissed, or the individual was acquitted at their retrial.\n\nErica Suter, Syed's attorney and director of the Innocence Project Clinic, praised the decision to drop charges as long overdue.\n\n\"While the proceedings are not completely over, this is an important step for Adnan, who has been on house arrest since the motion to vacate was first granted last month,\" she said.\n\nSyed had been wearing an ankle monitor with location tracking, but was taken off home monitoring on Tuesday, Suter said.\n\nIn the long term, Syed plans to continue his college education and has dreams of going to law school, she said. Today, though, he plans to spend time with his loved ones without being in home detention.\n\n\"The question we should all be asking is how many other Adnan Syeds are currently in prison or sentenced to life?\" said Colbert, one of Syed's first attorneys. \"Unfortunately, we as a society do not dedicate sufficient funds to ensure that poor people have the effective assistance of a lawyer who can devote the time and resources to a person's defense.\"\n\nCNN's Eric Levenson, Brian Vitagliano, Aya Elamroussi and Sonia Moghe contributed to this report.", "source":{"uri":"edition.cnn.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"CNN International"}, "authors":[{"uri":"emma_tucker@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Emma Tucker", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/media.cnn.com\/api\/v1\/images\/stellar\/prod\/220920143724-adnan-syed-released-0919.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":-0.01960784313725494, "wgt":403534680, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7226145527", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2022-10-15", "time":"12:58:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-15T12:58:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T12:12:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.5647059082984924, "url":"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2022\/10\/15\/politics\/trump-week-what-matters\/index.html", "title":"A dizzying week for Trump's legal issues | CNN Politics", "body":"Former President Donald Trump looks on during a campaign rally for Republican candidates in Nevada on October 8.\n\nA version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN --\n\nJust try keeping track of the dizzying web of legal issues confronting or somehow involving former President Donald Trump and his allies, all of which he lumps into the category of \"witch hunt.\"\n\nHere are some of the major developments this week:\n\nClassified documents - The Justice Department on Friday officially appealed the appointment of the special master to oversee the review of documents seized from Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in August. The special master had been requested by Trump, was granted by a Trump-appointed judge and had the effect of slowing the investigation. Congress - The House January 6 committee subpoenaed him for documents and testimony as it wrapped up its final public hearing before the midterm elections. The lawmakers want Trump to respond to their allegations, backed up by testimony at hearings, that Trump personally helped incite the Capitol insurrection and tried to overturn the 2020 election. Trump responded with a 14-page screed calling the committee's inquiry a \"Charade and Witch Hunt\" and repeating his lies about the 2020 elections - but without saying whether he will comply with the subpoena. Read a fact check of Trump's letter. New York - The state's attorney general, Letitia James, is trying to block Trump's company from transferring assets to any entities without court approval. The state says the same day it sued the Trump Organization, the company incorporated a new entity in Delaware. James is suing Trump, his three oldest children and his company for misrepresenting their assets to obtain favorable loan rates and tax benefits. In testimony before investigators earlier this year, before invoking his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination, Trump called the probe \"the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country.\" Georgia - CNN reported that a pro-Trump operative who was caught on tape participating in a Georgia voting system breach after the 2020 election testified before the special grand jury investigating efforts to overturn the outcome in that state, according to two sources. Federal January 6 investigation - Two former Trump administration officials were spotted outside the Washington, DC, courthouse where the federal grand jury investigating the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack meets. Marc Short was former Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff. Kash Patel was a Trump national security aide and Trump loyalist. Supreme Court - The court declined Trump's request for it to intervene in the Justice Department's investigation related to the Mar-a-Lago classified documents saga.\n\nThere's another case on the horizon:\n\nNew York City - Trump's company goes on trial by New York City prosecutors for breaking tax laws later this month. When the Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that prosecutors could access his financial information, of course Trump called it a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nNot all of the developments are unwelcome to Trump:\n\nSpecial counsel - Igor Danchenko, the primary source for the infamous and flawed dossier that helped spark the FBI probe of Trump's ties to Russia after the 2016 election, is on trial for lying to the FBI, although the judge dropped one of five charges against him Friday. The Russia investigation, remember, was what Trump first started calling a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nThe Danchenko trial is likely the last gasp of special counsel John Durham's inquiry into the Russia probe, which seems like a lifetime ago. That the Trump-requested special counsel to investigate the Russia investigation is still active years later means we can expect the aftershocks of Trump's presidency to continue for years to come.\n\nA video of former President Donald Trump is played during the House January 6 committee hearing on October 13. Alex Wong\/Getty Images\n\nIt could also be a model for what's to come. While inquiries into Trump's finances and his 2020 and 2021 actions led by state, city and federal authorities would continue, if Republicans win control of the House of Representatives as a result of November's election, they've indicated they'll shut down the January 6 committee and launch an investigation of the investigation.\n\nWe do not know how these various inquiries will end, but we can assume Trump will continue to say that elections are rigged even if Republicans seize control of the House and the Senate. He said there was massive voter fraud in the 2016 election, which he won. He said there was massive voter fraud in the 2020 election, which he publicly refuses to admit he lost.\n\nAnd we can assume he will continue to call any investigation a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nTrump will question any election\n\nAnother thing the House committee tried to do was allege Trump's plan to reject the 2020 results was \"premeditated.\"\n\nAs CNN's Chris Cillizza noted Thursday, Trump made very clear leading up to the election that he would reject the results.\n\n\"He wasn't keeping the plan he eventually executed - insisting the election was stolen - a big secret,\" Cillizza wrote of Trump, appending a list of times in 2020 when Trump refused to say he would abide by the results.\n\nAn interesting report on split-ticket voters in Georgia\n\nNow Republicans are looking to win control of the House and potentially the Senate, uncovering a great flaw of Trump's consistent gripes: If it's all rigged, how can Republicans win?\n\nCNN's Michael Warren reports from Georgia that voters there could reelect Republican Gov. Brian Kemp - in part because he stood up to Trump in 2020 by refusing to overturn election results in the state - but also send Democrat Raphael Warnock back to the Senate, in part because Trump's hand-picked candidate, Herschel Walker, is so flawed.\n\nTrump will benefit if Republicans can seize some power in the coming election, and he will declare it to be a vindication. But there's a strong argument that any GOP victory in November will happen in spite of him - which is something Republicans will need to grapple with because Trump and his allegations of a \"witch hunt\" aren't going anywhere.", "source":{"uri":"edition.cnn.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"CNN International"}, "authors":[{"uri":"zachary_b_wolf@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Zachary B.

In the mid-1950s, as more powerful thermonuclear bombs were being built and tested, military planners thought that smaller weapons with a shorter range would be more useful in \"tactical\" or military situations.\n\nModern warheads have a variable \"dial-up\" yield, meaning an operator can specify its explosive power, and a tactical weapon could be anywhere from a fraction of a kiloton to 50kt in strength.\n\nA single kiloton is equivalent in power to a thousand tons of high-explosive TNT.\n\nFor a sense of destructive scale, the weapon that destroyed Hiroshima was roughly 15kt.\n\nNuclear weapons possess several deadly aspects to them.\n\nThe heat from the blast can be hotter than the surface of the sun, the immense power released by the weapon producing an incredibly powerful blast wave that destroys everything in its path outward to several kilometres.\n\nOn detonation the intense radiation burst will kill anything living nearby and the resulting radioactive fallout poisons the ground for tens of kilometres from the blast zone, forming a deadly shroud that can kill weeks and even months later.\n\nA single tactical nuclear weapon could destroy an airfield, a port, concentrations of troops and tanks or supply depots. They can be delivered by aircraft, ballistic and cruise missiles; some can even be fired from artillery.\n\nDespite being a possible temptation to use by military leaders, no country has yet broken the seven-decade taboo on the use of nuclear weapons since the destruction of Nagasaki in 1945.\n\nWhile nuclear weapon stockpiles are much lower than during the Cold War, they are still large enough to be able to destroy most of humanity in a few hours.\n\nBattlefield nuclear weapons are only the trigger for what most analysts and politicians fear would be a quick and uncontrolled escalation to strategic nuclear weapon use and the destruction of civilisation being the inevitable result of such a conflict.\n\nThe inherent danger in the use of even a single nuclear weapon is that it would likely invite a terrible response from an opposing side in order to deter the opponent from using more.\n\nIt is the response, the attempt to firebreak a nuclear conflict before it gets started, that is also the mother of all gambles. Get it wrong and the world could die.\n\nIt is this fear that our destruction would be mutually assured (MAD - mutual assured destruction - military doctrine), that has kept militaries in check throughout the Cold War up until today.\n\nBut, if nuclear weapons are that awful why use them at all?\n\nRussia's reputation as a great power is in tatters. Its military has been exposed as shockingly inept and methodically brutal.\n\nRussian armed forces have suffered significant defeats. Driven from the outskirts of the capital, Kyiv, early in the invasion, Ukraine's successful counteroffensive is now driving Russian units from the towns they had initially captured in the northeast.\n\nRussia's flagship Moskva - a guided missile carrier - has been sunk; Snake island was recaptured from its Russian occupiers, the Kerch Strait bridge linking Crimea and Russia was badly damaged, and now Ukrainian forces are encroaching on a pocket of Russian forces, centred around Kherson city in the south. Ukraine is squeezing it daily and shrinking its perimeter as the tens of thousands of Russians there are increasingly cut off from the likelihood of resupply.\n\nThis is Russia's disastrous legacy in the conflict so far. President Putin has few choices left other than to admit defeat.\n\nThe call-up of 300,000 Russian reservists, a psychological shock to Russians and the first such call-up since World War II, has yet to make itself felt on the battlefields of Ukraine.\n\nWill they be enough in themselves to turn the tide against Ukrainian troops? While the arrival of large numbers of Russian reinforcements is not insignificant, there are persistent reports of poor equipment and a lack of warm clothing.\n\nThough battle-hardened, Ukrainian forces are also nearing exhaustion after months of constant combat.\n\nIf Putin's latest plan fails, he can either go for mass conscription, which will likely cause civil unrest, or further denude his armies in the east of the country. Able to send tens of thousands of troops to participate in September's Vostok military exercises during a war, the Russian president clearly still has significant resources at his disposal.\n\nHowever, Ukraine has learned the harsh lessons of 21st-century warfare while Russia is still mired in the past, its poorly trained soldiers so far being no match for the Ukrainians.\n\nIt is at this juncture that nuclear weapons' use would be the most likely, if it were to happen at all.\n\nThe first, and perhaps least likely, is an actual nuclear strike against an obvious military target on Ukrainian soil. It would be somewhere relatively unpopulated in an effort to minimise the spread of radiation, an air burst over an air base or a concentration of troops.\n\nNot only would this be relatively ineffectual given the dispersed nature of Ukrainian forces, but it could likely invite an immediate and significant reprisal attack directly by the United States and NATO forces.\n\nThe dangers of escalation are all too grim and obvious.\n\nThe second scenario would be a demonstration over the Black Sea in international waters. While a massive pollutant and still risky, it would not be the obvious trigger for a NATO response and potential escalation could still be stopped at that level.\n\nThe third, and perhaps most likely use of any Russian nuclear weapon would be to conduct a test on Russian soil, on one of the old Soviet nuclear test sites in the north, like Novaya Zemlya. Though breaking the Test Ban Treaty on atmospheric testing, it would be unlikely to invite a military response from NATO.\n\nSuch a test would remind the world that Russia has other means at its disposal in the form of terrifying weapons, that its humiliation will only go so far, and it is resolved to use them if Russia is not allowed to extricate itself from this conflict with something that does not look like total defeat - a 50kt bargaining chip, with megatonnes in reserve.\n\nWhichever scenario is played out, the detonation of a nuclear weapon would likely trigger panic around the world followed by civil disorder as cities empty. There would also be chaos on global stock markets as currencies and stocks plunge in value.\n\nWhile still low, for the first time in decades the probability that nuclear weapons could be used is not zero.\n\nNo one has anything to gain from nuclear conflagration.\n\nBut an embattled Putin may feel he is being forced to make a desperate gamble.\n\nHis high-risk use of one of the few tools left available to him could help stop a war, his war, from ending in total defeat for Russia, allowing its forces to leave the battlefield beaten but not completely broken.", "source":{"uri":"aljazeera.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors":[{"uri":"alex_gatopoulos@aljazeera.com", "name":"Alex Gatopoulos", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/2022-10-07T080219Z_81262933_RC2NVW9Y8ZEJ_RTRMADP_3_RUSSIA-PUTIN.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440", "eventUri":"spa-2908069", "sentiment":-0.1764705882352942, "wgt":403529760, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7226056749", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2022-10-15", "time":"11:09:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-15T11:09:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T10:41:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.95686274766922, "url":"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2022\/10\/15\/weather\/mississippi-river-low-water-tower-rock-climate\/index.html", "title":"The mighty Mississippi is so low, people are walking to a unique rock formation rarely accessible by foot | CNN", "body":"CNN --\n\nTower Rock - a massive island in the middle of the Mississippi River south of St. Louis - is typically surrounded by water and only accessible by boat.

The Army Corps of Engineers has been dredging portions of the river to keep traffic flowing - albeit at a much slower pace. Hundreds of barges and vessels have been queuing up, waiting for the all-clear to pass through the treacherously-low river.\n\nThe Consolidated Grain and Barge Company, which buys, stores and sells crops for shipping, can usually move grain on barges loaded up to 80,000 bushels, according to David Gilbert, the company's superintendent at its Greenville, Mississippi, office.\n\nBut recently the low water levels have forced the company to keep the loads far lighter, at around 55,000 bushels.\n\n\"I ain't seen it lower than it is now,\" Gilbert told CNN. \"We're not loading right now.\"\n\nGilbert said that instead of shipping their harvests right now, many farmers are \"just throwing it in their bins\" and waiting for better conditions, which could still be weeks away.\n\nTower Rock, left, taken this week.

It currently sits atop the table - albeit only goal difference separating it from champion Real.\n\nMadrid, which won last season's title at a canter, perhaps holds a mental advantage going into this season's first El Clasico.\n\nWhile Madrid progressed into the Champions League knockout stages courtesy of a last-minute equalizer against Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday, Barcelona's hopes of a last-16 berth hang by a thread after a dramatic draw against Inter Milan.\n\nRobert Lewandowski tops La Liga's scoring charts.

Furthermore, in any Premier League match that it has conceded a goal at all, the opponent has always scored first.\n\nErling Haaland was rested ahead of his side's trip to Liverpool. Laurence Griffiths\/Getty Images Europe\/Getty Images\n\nLiverpool currently sits 10th in the league, already 14 points behind second-placed Manchester City, who trail leader Arsenal by a single point.\n\nA cathartic 7-1 thrashing against Rangers in the Champions League on Wednesday will go someway to boosting momentum heading into the game, with Mohamed Salah also returning to form with a brilliant hattrick.\n\n\"Yes it changed the mood completely but we all know who we are welcoming on Sunday and this will be a different game, but it's better to go into it with this feeling we've got tonight than any other,\" manager Jurgen Klopp said after Wednesday's win.\n\nLiverpool will be facing a City side which has been blowing teams away this season, scoring 33 goals in nine games.\n\nWorryingly for the Reds, City coach Pep Guardiola was able to rest key players in its 0-0 draw against FC Copenhagen on Tuesday and they will be fresh for their trip to Anfield.\n\nOne of those players is Erling Haaland, who has been nothing short of a revelation this season.\n\nHe appears to be the missing piece in City's bid to win a first Champions League title. The 22-year-old is in an unprecedented scoring form having already netted 15 times in just nine league games.\n\nAccording to Gracenote, Manchester City is creating three major chances per game this season, a frightening statistic when combined with the scoring form of attackers Haaland and Phil Foden.\n\nHowever, if any defender can stop City it's likely to be Van Dijk. The Dutchman has not been at his best so far this season but a battle against Haaland may prove to be just the motivation he needs.\n\nGiven Anfield is likely to be bouncing on Sunday, this City side may be facing its toughest test to date.\n\nParis Saint-Germain vs. Marseille\n\nFinally to France, where reigning champion PSG hosts a historically feisty clash against Marseille, in a game dubbed Le Classique.\n\nOnly three points separate the two sides - PSG sits top while Marseille is in third - but this may not be a bad time for visitors to travel to the French capital.\n\nPSG has been rocked by the swirling speculation around Kylian Mbapp\u00e9's future and the league leader could be missing some of its biggest names for Sunday's clash.\n\nWhile PSG has played down rumors surrounding Mbapp\u00e9, many top journalists have said the star striker is not happy with the club's hierarchy and is eying a transfer away from the team.\n\nKylian Mbapp\u00e9 rumors has made life tricky for PSG.

You've tried to schedule an appointment with a specialist -- if you were able to find one -- only to discover waiting lists of six months or longer.\n\n\"There was this explosion of patient calls after the pandemic started, and we couldn't see 10% of the patients that wanted to come to the clinic,\" said Dr. Justin Turner, associate professor of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nUnfortunately, that's still the case, leaving many who have yet to recover their sense of smell and taste struggling to find help, said rhinologist Dr. Zara Patel, who is a surgeon who focuses on treatment of the nose and sinuses.\n\n\"One of the big problems we realized at the beginning of the pandemic is that almost no one other than a few specialists knew anything about smell loss and how to go about diagnosing or treating it,\" said Patel, a professor of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery at Stanford University School of Medicine in California.\n\nBoth Stanford and Vanderbilt have established clinics to treat and research smell loss, two of a handful in the United States.\n\n\"The sad and most common thing I hear from patients in my clinic who have seen multiple physicians before they get to me is that they were told: 'There's really nothing you can do. You'll just have to see if your smell will come back with time,'\" Patel said.\n\n\"When in reality, the sooner we start any definitive intervention, the more likely we are to be able to bring back smell.\"\n\nTo address the issue, Patel said she gathered 50 experts to create a 600-plus-page consensus that combined vetted scientific knowledge and medical best practices on smell loss.\n\n\"It's the first peer-reviewed compendium of its kind on olfaction,\" Patel said. \"And it's open access -- not just for physicians, but for patients, for anyone to read.\"\n\nThe guidelines, published in the journal International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology, lay out a plan of action for general practitioners on how to examine, diagnose and treat smell loss -- including when to make referrals to a specialist.\n\nPatel encourages people with smell loss to print out the clinical assessment (see below) and take it to their doctor.\n\n\"We wrote this as a resource for patients to advocate for themselves -- and for physicians who simply just don't have the training or the expertise in this area,\" Patel said. \"They don't just have to say, 'Oh, there's nothing that you can do.' They can use this and learn about the different options for treatment.\"\n\nA trip to the doctor\n\nThe clinical assessment outlines a recommended order for the diagnosis of smell loss from any cause, not just Covid-19.\n\nPatient history: A physician should take a detailed patient history, according to the guidelines. That will include questions about onset, severity and psychological impact of the loss of smell, along with possible culprits such as exposure to toxic chemicals, injuries or surgery to the head or nose, and radiation for cancer.\n\nHeadaches, chronic sinus issues, autoimmune disorders, some medications and vitamin or mineral deficiencies can be associated with smell loss as well as the common cold, flu and other viral illnesses such as Covid-19.\n\nAge also can play a factor -- all of us partially lose our sense of smell as more olfactory nerves fail to regenerate. People with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis often have smell loss due to their illness's impact on the brain.\n\nSmell test: The doctor should administer a verified smell test. However, be aware some tests may not be sensitive enough to pick up subtle nuances in loss of smell, possibly leading a doctor to say nothing is wrong.\n\nSome patients had that experience early in the pandemic when about 60% of people who had the Alpha and Delta variants complained of smell and taste loss, Turner said.\n\n\"When those patients started to be objectively tested, that positivity rate went way up -- around 80% or even 90% of patients had some form of dysfunction if you really tested them,\" Turner said.\n\nIt can also work in reverse, with many people unaware of nuances in smell recovery, said Dr. Eric Holbrook, an associate professor of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery at Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n\n\"There's been papers showing that humans have difficulty assessing gradual change in their sense of smell,\" Holbrook said. \"Testing can differentiate a little bit, and it can be encouraging for some people to see that there has been a change.\"\n\nA full physical exam should be a part of any doctor visit for smell loss, the guidelines state. John Leicester\/AP\/FILE\n\nPhysical workup: A full physical exam should be done, including a nasal endoscopy and an examination of cranial nerves. If the patient history shows evidence of a neurological disorder or chronic sinus inflammation, further testing should be ordered, the guidelines note.\n\nIf tests are positive, the patient should be referred to a specialist to treat that specific disorder. For example, a person with chronic sinusitis would be referred to a rhinologist.\n\nIf a specialist is needed, Patel suggested using the American Rhinologic Society's website to find one in your area.\n\nPotential treatments\n\nThe guidelines recommend various treatments, depending on the cause of the smell loss.\n\nUnderlying disorder: If the loss of smell is due to an underlying disease, such as chronic sinusitis or neurological condition, the guidelines suggest physicians refer the patient to a specialist and provide treatment options.\n\nSurgery and trauma: If the loss is due to skull surgery, treatment with omega-3 fatty acids is recommended. If trauma such as a car accident is the cause, oral zinc and topical vitamin A are options.\n\n\"Using the term 'options' means that either there is very low level data that it may help,\" Patel said, \"or there are conflicting studies where some show it helps and some do not, but there is no data to suggest harm.\"\n\nViral infections: If the smell loss is a result of a viral infection such as Covid-19 or the flu, a recommended treatment is smell training, a process in which patients practice smelling scents twice each day for at least six months.\n\n\"We start with four odors that are in different categories of smell so that they will stimulate different types of olfactory receptor neurons in your nose: lemon, rose, eucalyptus and clove,\" Patel said.\n\nAnother recommendation is the use of steroids via a squeeze bottle nasal irrigation device similar to a neti pot, Patel said. Steroid nasal sprays don't reach far enough up into the nose to reach the olfactory nerves.\n\n\"We add a topical steroid to the saltwater rinse and that allows you to bathe the neurons in the nose with a potent anti-inflammatory medication,\" she said.\n\nSafety studies on the use of steroids for chronic sinusitis patients have shown the body absorbs few steroids this way, she added: \"So you don't run into all those side effects that people get when they take steroids systemically by mouth or by injection.\"\n\nOther treatment options (not fully supported by research) for viral-induced smell loss may include topical vitamin A and omega-3 fatty oil supplements, the guidelines note.\n\nThe consensus also specifies which medications and treatments have little to no science supporting their use, such as systemic vitamin A, oral or nasal zinc, oral steroids or steroid nasal sprays, and platelet-rich plasma nasal injections.\n\nWhen smells are nasty\n\nPeople with smell loss can suddenly begin smelling vile odors: Food and drink smell rotten, decayed, metallic or chemically pungent. Doctors call the condition parosmia, caused when smell receptors fail to deliver accurate information to the brain. Distorted smell can occur after head trauma, neurological conditions or viral infections such as Covid-19.\n\n\"Parosmia is something that we have always seen with post-viral smell loss,\" Patel said, \"but not nearly to the same extent as we see it with Covid-19-related smell problems.\"\n\nThe good news is that experts think parosmia is a sign of recovery. The guidelines consider smell training and certain medications as treatment options.\n\n\"Some people may respond to medications we call neuro-modulating agents -- gabapentin, pregabalin, amitriptyline -- medications that modulate the nerve signal back to the brain,\" Patel said.\n\nEmotional fallout\n\nFinally, the guidelines state that your physician should discuss the emotional impact that a loss of smell can have and offer referrals to therapists or specialists as needed.\n\nSome people manage fine without a sense of smell, Patel said. For others, it can lead to depression and malnutrition, especially if smell is distorted.\n\n\"Imagine you went to go eat and the food smelled and tasted like rotting flesh,\" Patel said. \"People end up with wild fluctuations where they lose a ton of weight, then they gain a ton of weight by finding some bland but highly fatty or starchy-type food that is safe for them.\"\n\nGroups such as Fifth Sense and the Smell and Taste Association of North America have mobilized to help, offering affirmation and hope, tips on smell training and even recipes to bolster appetite.\n\n\"A lot of our enjoyment of our environment is actually through our sense of smell,\" Turner said. \"Simple things like the smell of spring flowers, the smell of your child and your spouse or your significant other are ingrained in our minds.\"", "source":{"uri":"edition.cnn.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"CNN International"}, "authors":[{"uri":"sandee_lamotte@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Sandee LaMotte", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/media.cnn.com\/api\/v1\/images\/stellar\/prod\/221012155037-long-covid-smell-loss-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":-0.1058823529411764, "wgt":403527000, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7225982834", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2022-10-15", "time":"09:45:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-15T09:45:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T09:25:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2022\/10\/15\/us\/gulfport-mississippi-police-shooting-investigation\/index.html", "title":"The fatal shooting of a 15-year-old by police in Mississippi is under state investigation, officials say | CNN", "body":"CNN --\n\nThe Mississippi Bureau of Investigations has launched a probe regarding a police officer shooting and killing a teenager earlier this month in the city of Gulfport, police said, as attorneys for the teen's family call for video footage of the incident to be released.\n\nLaw enforcement officers responded to a 911 call on October 6 of multiple people in a vehicle brandishing firearms, Gulfport Police Chief Adam Cooper said at a news briefing this week.

In July, they were sitting on $713 billion in inventory, according to the latest data from the Census Bureau.\n\nThat's a prime opportunity for \"off-price\" retailers such as TJX (TJX) - the parent of TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods - as well as Ross (ROST), Burlington (BURL) and Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI).\n\nThese chains have flexible buying models and are able to scoop up unwanted merchandise from suppliers at steep discounts to their initial wholesale price.\n\nUnlike brands and stores that lock in their inventory six months to a year in advance, TJX and other off-price chains buy surplus merchandise to sell it right away. They also capitalize on orders that have been canceled or when companies manufacture too many items.\n\nAnd if a designer changes the style or color of a dress, for example, off-price stores are happy to take it and sell it on the cheap.\n\nIf the price is right, these companies will also buy some merchandise and store it away for future seasons - a practice known as packaway.\n\nBy buying goods cheap and controlling costs with limited advertising budgets, off-price stores can sell designer names and mid-range brands anywhere from 20% to 60% below regular retailers' prices.\n\nCompanies and analysts say the current inventory pileup across retail is the ideal environment for off-price chains.\n\nThe inventories of Nike (NKE), Gap (GPS), Kohl's (KSS), Target (TGT) and other companies have ballooned from a year ago. \"We effectively have a few seasons landing in the marketplace at the same time,\" Nike (NKE) CEO John Donahoe said on a call with analysts last month.\n\nFactory closures last year and in 2020 delayed shipments, as did widespread container ship shortages and supply chain backlogs. Inflation also has pinched shoppers' pockets, leading them to pass on discretionary items.\n\nCompanies now are aggressively marking down their excess goods to stimulate customer demand.

It was a mistake when we're going to be asking for difficult decisions across the board on tax and spending to cut the rate of tax paid by the very wealthiest,\" Hunt told Sky News on Saturday in his first full day as chancellor of the exchequer.\n\n\"It was a mistake to fly blind and to do these forecasts without giving people the confidence of the Office of Budget Responsibility saying that the sums add up.

It also comes a day after Truss fired Kwarteng as her chancellor and scrapped parts of their controversial economic package in a desperate bid for political survival, less than 40 days into her premiership.\n\nKwarteng's fiscal statement on September 23 prompted a backlash in financial markets that was so ferocious that the Bank of England had to intervene to prevent pension funds from being caught up in the chaos as borrowing costs surged.\n\nIn a hurried news conference shortly after dismissing Kwarteng, Truss said the corporation tax rate would increase, abandoning her plan to keep it at current levels, and government spending would rise by less than previously planned.\n\nBig, unfunded tax cuts were a central plank of Truss's original plans, but Hunt said tax increases were on the cards.\n\n\"We will have some very difficult decisions ahead,\" he said.\n\n\"The thing that people want, the markets want, the country needs now, is stability,\" Hunt said. \"No chancellor can control the markets. But what I can do is show that we can pay for our tax and spending plans and that is going to need some very difficult decisions on both spending and tax.\"\n\nHunt is due to announce the government's medium-term budget plans on October 31, a key test of its ability to show investors that it can restore its economic policy credibility.\n\nHe said spending would not rise by as much as people would like and all government departments were going to have to find more efficiencies than they were planning.\n\n\"Some taxes will not be cut as quickly as people want, and some taxes will go up.

CCP General Secretary and China's President Xi Jinping is all but guaranteed to stay at the helm for a third term after the congress.\n\nYet while he will emerge from the congress more powerful than ever by placing more loyalists in the party's apex bodies, the Politburo and its Standing Committee, both Xi and the CCP face difficult questions that have no answers at the moment.\n\nThe extent to which Xi is able to reshape the CCP's leadership group and bring major changes to policy directions depends on how much support he has among the 2,296 delegates attending.\n\nWhat is clear is that no heir apparent to Xi will be identified at the congress. Such a succession void may increase uncertainties for a future power transition -- an issue central to the power play that guides Chinese elite politics.\n\nAhead of the congress, China has tightened travel restrictions and information flow around Beijing. However, the outcomes of the summit, held once every five years, will resonate far beyond the capital city.\n\nAt the 19th CCP Congress in 2017, Xi successfully had his political vision, officially worded as Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, written into the CCP's constitution. That made him only the third leader -- after Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping -- to have his political doctrine incorporated in the party charter.\n\nOver the next few days, Xi's effort to further consolidate power and set up what he has described as a \"new normal\" for China's economy and politics will determine the future path of the world's second-largest economy in his \"new era\".\n\nSince coming to power at the 18th CCP Congress in 2012, Xi has shaken up China's politics, including through a relentless anti-corruption campaign, stern ideological control and crackdowns on tech and property gurus.\n\nStill, though Xi Jinping Thought was included in the CCP's fundamental documents at the 19th congress in 2017, he at that time appeared to have made compromises with other party elders. Among those accommodations was the continued strict adherence to an informal age criterion, which required new members of the Politburo and Standing Committee to be younger than 68 when the congress is convened.\n\nAs a result, the new Standing Committee in 2017 was filled with leaders from diverse political backgrounds -- including the Communist Youth League, coastal regions and inland provinces -- not all of whom owed their political rise to Xi.\n\nThis time Xi has set the stage to break with that pattern. In September, the CCP published new regulations on the promotion and demotion of leading party cadres, which removed the mandatory retirement ages and term limits for the appointment of senior officials.\n\nThe new rules play down the importance of age limits significantly and open the door to the promotion and retention of leaders older than 67 in the Politburo. This has added more uncertainties to the final line-up of top leaders on the eve of the CCP Congress as all the seven incumbent Politburo Standing Committee members could, in theory, stay on.\n\nHowever, a new set of promotion criteria is in play to reshape the leadership team and avoid disruptive power struggles, with the following apparent order of priority -- loyalty to Xi, performance, technocratic backgrounds and age.\n\nUnder this approach, Xi's loyalists will gain in numbers in the Politburo and its Standing Committee. However, no clear successor to Xi will be anointed. That could set the stage for future uncertainties -- and potential tensions.\n\nThe issue of successions has affected the country's political stability since the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. In particular, power succession in the 1980s did not go smoothly, as evidenced by the ousting of Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang, leaders who were seen by the party orthodoxy as being too politically liberal in the face of a rising tide of student protests.\n\nSince then, the party leadership has made enormous efforts to institutionalise elite politics. Many formal institutions have been established, but informal rules continue to play a role in handling power succession.\n\nBy breaking with those rules, Xi now must use his personal authority to eventually set up a \"new normal\" for the selection of his successor. That won't necessarily be a smooth process and might be challenged by intense intra-party competition.\n\nIn the meantime, the CCP will not totally dismantle its collective leadership model at the top, despite Xi's ever-growing power.\n\nEconomically liberal candidates who are not linked to Xi may still join the Politburo Standing Committee. Vice Premier Hu Chunhua, a Politburo member with a Communist Youth League background, is well-positioned to be a candidate for next premier, with incumbent Li Keqiang already making clear that he does not expect to stay on. Hu may favour further marketisation and the opening up of the economy.\n\nAnother vice premier, Liu He, trusted by Xi and supportive of market reforms and opening up, also has the chance to become the next premier.\n\nWhile the party will continue to exercise its strict ideological control after the congress, the crackdown on businesses might subside for a while to urgently boost and stimulate a sagging economy. Some restrictions over the property, finance and tech sectors may be relaxed.\n\nAlthough there are few signs to suggest that China will ease its draconian zero-COVID policy soon, the conclusion of the CCP Congress will make the leadership more confident about cross-border travel. Xi and his colleagues will go abroad more often to seek international influence, while lower-level visits to other countries may gradually resume after the composition of the State Council, China's cabinet, is approved by the annual parliamentary sessions in March 2023.\n\nXi's signature diplomatic strategy, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), will continue unabated. However, in recent years, China has emphasised the improvement of people's livelihoods more than the scale of infrastructure projects in participating countries.\n\nXi himself has highlighted issues like climate change, sustainable development and digital connectivity along the Belt and Road. New slogans such as \"green silk road\" and \"digital silk road\" will likely emerge for the promotion of the BRI after the party congress.\n\nDespite Xi's unprecedented power at the 20th CCP Congress, the \"road\" ahead for China might be more than green, silky or digital -- it might also be uncertain as its once-institutionalised politics and economy have entered uncharted waters.\n\nThe new rules on promotion and demotion of cadres have made leadership reshuffling less predictable, while the unabated anti-corruption campaign in the name of \"self-revolution\" is paralysing millions of bureaucrats into risk aversion and may dampen their enthusiasm for economic growth.\n\nXi can't afford that in his third term. If enough officials opt for \"lying flat\" -- or tangping -- they could send China's development drive into a similar state of stupor.", "source":{"uri":"aljazeera.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/AP22287135429993.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440", "eventUri":"eng-8090075", "sentiment":0.223529411764706, "wgt":403519080, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7225913776", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":true, "date":"2022-10-15", "time":"08:22:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-15T08:22:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T07:33:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2022\/10\/15\/europe\/russia-ukraine-rape-sexual-violence-military-intl-hnk\/index.html?eref=mrss_igoogle_cnn", "title":"Russia using rape as 'military strategy' in Ukraine: UN envoy | CNN", "body":"CNN --\n\nRussia is using rape and sexual violence as part of its \"military strategy\" in Ukraine, a UN envoy said this week.\n\nThe claim follows data released by a panel of UN experts recently that verified \"more than a hundred cases\" of rape or sexual assault incidents reported in Ukraine since February.\n\n\"When you hear women testify about Russian soldiers equipped with Viagra, it's clearly a military strategy,\" Pramila Patten, UN Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, said in an interview with AFP on Thursday.\n\nShe added that many cases involved children and also said that the true number of victims was likely to be far higher than official figures suggested because sexual crimes are often \"under reported.\"\n\n\"There are many cases of sexual violence against children who are raped, tortured and sequestered,\" Patten said.\n\n\"I have not stopped since February to emphasize the importance of having credible investigations into these cases of violence.\"\n\nSince the Russian invasion began, Ukrainian officials have repeatedly accused Moscow's forces of sexually abusing women and children, claiming they are using rape and other sexual acts as weapons of war.\n\nUkraine's Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Kateryna Pavlichenko in June said that police received around 50 complaints of sexual crimes committed by Russian soldiers.\n\nProsecutors are also investigating rape allegations in the Kharkiv region after Ukrainian forces recently recaptured territory there.\n\nCNN has spoken with Ukrainian women, one of them a pregnant 16-year-old, who shared harrowing accounts detailing sexual assault.\n\nCNN could not independently verify the latest claims by the UN.\n\nRussian authorities have denied allegations of war crimes in Ukraine.", "source":{"uri":"edition.cnn.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"CNN International"}, "authors":[{"uri":"tim_lister@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Tim Lister", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}, {"uri":"philip_wang@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Philip Wang", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}, {"uri":"heather_chen@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Heather Chen", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}, {"uri":"josh_pennington@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Josh Pennington", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/media.cnn.com\/api\/v1\/images\/stellar\/prod\/221015020619-02-un-russia-ukraine-rape-sexual-violence-military-intl-hnk-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":-0.403921568627451, "wgt":403518120, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7225913778", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":true, "date":"2022-10-15", "time":"08:22:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-15T08:22:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T08:01:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.5921568870544434, "url":"http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2022\/10\/15\/world\/russia-ukraine-war-rocket-drones-missile-strike-kyiv-zaporizhzhia-intl-hnk\/index.html?eref=mrss_igoogle_cnn", "title":"Kamikaze drones hit Zaporizhzhia, rocket strikes Kyiv, Ukrainian officials say | CNN", "body":"CNN --\n\nUkrainian officials say the southern city of Zaporizhzhia came under attack again early Saturday, in an assault involving kamikaze drones and missiles.\n\nThe city was struck by \"10 or more\" C300 missiles Saturday morning, following four strikes by \"kamikaze\" drones overnight, said Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia's regional military administration.\n\n\"As a result of the Shahed-136 UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) attack, infrastructure facilities in the city of Zaporizhzhia were destroyed.

She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN --\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin's so-far-disastrous invasion of Ukraine is turning the former idol of the far right into a toxic figure among many who used to be his greatest admirers.\n\nFrida Ghitis\n\nFor years, as Western democracies became more polarized, the extreme right started to see the Russian strongman as a role model. After all, Putin claimed to be motivated by a passion for safeguarding ultra-conservative values, even as he trained much of his venom against the United States.\n\nBut now, Putin's brutal onslaught of a neighboring country has exposed a side of the Russian dictator that many had managed to ignore until now.\n\nThe daily images of bombed out schools, hospitals, playgrounds and apartment buildings, and the determined, so-far-largely-successful pushback by Ukraine, has prompted many - though not all - former fans to reconsider their admiration.\n\nLeaders of the extreme right, seeing the transformation in popular opinion, have pivoted sharply. After championing a Russian leader who was already dictatorial and ruthless, they now seek to benefit from the economic havoc triggered by Putin's war, while distancing themselves from a man who is now seen not only as a moral pariah by many of their followers, but also as a catastrophically ineffective leader.\n\nThose lured by the reframed rhetoric should be warned. In many cases, extremists are just changing wardrobe. They've known who Putin was all along.\n\nA toxic figure\n\nAcross the West, Putin has now become one of the world's most despised figures. A Pew survey of 18 countries found positive views of the Russian leader at an incredible 10% or less.\n\nAt the United Nations, Putin is more isolated every day. The UN General Assembly Wednesday voted to reject his annexation of Ukrainian territory by a margin of 143 to five, with 35 abstentions. That's an even greater margin than previous UN resolutions condemning Russia's actions, also overwhelmingly approved.\n\nWhen Italians went to the polls last month, the candidates of the far right were quick to distance themselves from their former hero.\n\nGiorgia Meloni, leader of the post-fascist Brothers of Italy and now slated to become prime minister, dispensed with her formerly warm words toward Putin and vowed to continue sending weapons to help Ukraine. Likewise, Matteo Salvini, who once called Putin \"the best statesman on Earth\" and used to sport a shirt with Putin's face on it, now insists he supports Ukraine.\n\nThe source of their reconsideration may be found in a separate Pew poll that revealed favorable opinions of Putin and Russia among far-right members have collapsed since Russia invaded Ukraine. Among Salvini's Lega backers, confidence in Putin to do the right thing regarding world affairs collapsed, from 62% last year to 10% now.\n\nBalancing act\n\nAcross Europe, supporters of far-right parties are turning their back not only on Putin but also on Russia. Their leaders are anxiously looking for ways to navigate the rapids.\n\nConsider France's Marine Le Pen, whose warm encounters with Putin have come back to haunt her. The Putin we see today, she pleads, is \"not the one\" she met when she visited Moscow as a presidential candidate advocating stronger ties with Russia. Only a year ago, most supporters of her own National Rally (RN) had a positive view of Russia. That number is just 21% now.\n\nPro-Russia positions are so poisonous that the RN's acting president, Jordan Bardella, threatened to sue anyone who suggests there are financial ties between the party and Russia. (Le Pen's presidential campaign was partly financed by a mysterious multimillion dollar loan from Russia in 2014. Le Pen said French banks refused to give her a loan.)\n\nInstead of focusing on the war, some far-right parties now hold demonstrations criticizing the high cost of living made worse by Western sanctions against Russia. On the surface it's a populist position, all about helping the people at home. Beneath the slogans, however, there's a message that helps Putin by attacking economic sanctions and raising pressure on politicians to ease up on support for Ukraine.\n\nThat's the case in Germany, where some in the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party have openly expressed support for Russia, but the leadership has tried to tone it down while mobilizing opposition to Berlin's policies - on the grounds that it creates hardships for Germans.\n\nAcross the Atlantic\n\nIt's a balancing act that's being tried in the US, sometimes with embarrassing results.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, CPAC, the conservative political action group, tweeted a cringeworthy message that framed the conflict along Putin's preferred lines, calling on Democrats to \"end the gift-giving to Ukraine\" and focus on the US. The group soon deleted the post, apologetically, with claims that it didn't go through proper vetting.\n\nBut it's no secret that the far right in the United States has been as enthralled with Putin as its Western European friends.\n\nAt the far-right America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC) in February, days after Russian started bombing Ukraine, AFPAC founder and notorious White nationalist Nick Fuentes bellowed, \"Can we get a round of applause for Russia!\"\n\nAt the same, at the CPAC conference, former President Donald Trump, long a Putin admirer, was already under fire. As Putin inched toward war, declaring portions of Ukraine, \"independent,\" Trump sided with Putin, calling his approach to Ukraine \"genius,\" explaining, \"Here's a guy who's very savvy...I know him very well.\"\n\nTrump held his ground, repeating his praise of the Russian dictator and claiming, \"Putin is playing Biden like a drum, and it's not pretty to watch.\" (Trump hasn't been praising Putin as much lately. More often using the war to praise himself.)\n\nOver the months, Putin's \"genius\" and \"savvy\" have come under question as the invasion has not only faltered, but has caused him to lose support in unexpected places.\n\nEven the leaders of former Soviet Republics, including autocratic ones Putin protected in the past, are letting him down. Only one, the Belarussian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, has stood with the Kremlin.\n\nIn the US - where 73% of the people want continued support for Ukraine even after Putin threatened to use nuclear weapons - a few prominent far-right figures still defend him.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter\n\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nFox News' Tucker Carlson is such a useful voice for Putin propaganda that clips from his nightly show are a mainstay in Russian state-controlled television. The spectacle caused a host at an even more right-wing network, Newsmax, to lambast him. Eric Bolling referred to Carlson as an \"alleged American\" for defending \"our archenemy Russia and the sociopath Putin...\"\n\nOpenly supporting Putin has turned out to be the a more complicated strategy than the far right expected. In fact, their history of backing a man whose tyrannical leanings were visible long ago remains cautionary evidence of the core ideology of many of Putin's former - and current - supporters.", "source":{"uri":"edition.cnn.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"CNN International"}, "authors":[{"uri":"frida_ghitis@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Frida Ghitis", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/media.cnn.com\/api\/v1\/images\/stellar\/prod\/220930114911-01-putin-ukraine-annexation-0930.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":0.223529411764706, "wgt":403518060, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7225907418", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2022-10-15", "time":"08:13:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-15T08:13:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T07:36:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.4980392158031464, "url":"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2022\/10\/15\/us\/raleigh-north-carolina-shooting-saturday\/index.html", "title":"Juvenile suspect in Raleigh mass shooting will face charges as an adult, prosecutor says | CNN", "body":"Raleigh, North Carolina CNN --\n\nA 15-year-old will be charged as an adult for allegedly carrying out a mass shooting that left five people dead Thursday in Raleigh, North Carolina, prosecutors said, as calls to curb gun violence are renewed once again in the US.\n\nThe suspect, identified by police as a White male juvenile, was taken into custody by law enforcement after an hours-long manhunt Thursday.\n\nThe sprawling crime scene of more than two miles across the Raleigh neighborhood of Hedingham also left two people wounded in the attack, officials said. One of the five victims killed was off-duty police officer Gabriel Torres, 29, who shot while on his way to work.\n\n\"My heart is heavy, because we don't have answers as to why this tragedy occurred,\" Raleigh Police Chief Estella D. Patterson said during a news briefing Friday.\n\nWake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman told CNN on Friday her office intends on charging the suspect as an adult.\n\nHe is hospitalized in critical condition following his apprehension Thursday night after a standoff with police, officials said. Freeman said her office is monitoring the suspect's condition.\n\nAs authorities investigate, few details have been provided related to how exactly the shooting unfolded.\n\nIn one of four 911 calls obtained by CNN, a caller told a dispatcher that the shooter was wearing camouflage and looked like he was 16. The caller said the gunman \"walked by and shot\" a police officer \"for no reason.\" Another caller reported that two neighbors had been shot. A third caller reported that a \"kid running around here with a shotgun\" shot a person and \"ran back into the woods.\"\n\nThe suspect donned camouflage clothing and carried a camouflage backpack, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. After the shooting, a handgun and long gun were recovered, according to the source.\n\nThe other deceased victims identified by police are Nicole Conners, 52; Sue Karnatz, 49; Mary Marshall, 35; and James Roger Thompson, 16.\n\nThe two victims who were wounded include a responding police officer, who was later released from care.\n\nMarcille Lynn Gardner, 59, remains in critical condition, Patterson said.\n\nThe mass shooting prompted a response from President Joe Biden, who lamented the harrowing loss of Americans to gun violence yet again and reiterated his call for an assault weapon ban.\n\n\"Enough,\" Biden said. \"We've grieved and prayed with too many families who have had to bear the terrible burden of these mass shootings.\n\n\"Too many families have had spouses, parents, and children taken from them forever,\" the President added.\n\nFamilies, community in mourning\n\nBiden's remarks come as the Raleigh community grieves the sudden loss of loved ones and neighbors.\n\nKarnatz, one of the victims killed, was described by her husband, Tom, as a loving wife and mother to three boys, whose ages are 10, 13 and 14.\n\n\"We had plans together for growing old. Always together. Now those plans are laid to waste,\" he wrote Friday on social media.\n\nChristine Hines, who is Karnatz' neighbor, said she feels as if her heart had been pierced by the loss. The pair had seen each other the day of the shooting while walking their dogs.\n\nMarshall, another victim who was killed, was also walking her dog when she heard gunshots ring out, her sister Meaghan McCrickard told CNN.\n\nAfter hearing the shots, Marshall called her fianc\u00e9 to tell him about the firing and said she was heading back to the house, McCrickard said.\n\n\"She was my hero despite being my younger sister,\" McCrickard added. The sisters were three years apart.\n\nMarshall, a culinary arts alumnus of Wake Technical Community College, was described by faculty and classmates as \"a hard worker with a good attitude and a determination to succeed,\" the school said in a statement.\n\nThompson was a junior at Knightdale High School when he was fatally shot Thursday, principal Keith Richardson said in a statement.\n\n\"It is an unexpected loss and we are saddened by it,\" said Richardson, noting that counseling and crisis services are available for students and staff.\n\nPolice at the scene at Castle Pines Dr. and Sahalee Way following a shooting Thursday night in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Friday.

She was completely in shock.\"\n\nThe resident and her daughter locked themselves in a bedroom after an officer in an unmarked car told them there was an active shooter.\n\n\"I started crying,\" her daughter recalled. And on Friday morning, she cried again.\n\n\"Imagining what people are going through,\" she said. \"And the fact that it was so close to us. It could have been us.\"\n\nMcCrickard, Marshall's sister, expressed frustration that gun violence has not been restrained further.\n\n\"We want to take this unimaginable opportunity to beg our local, national, and country leaders to finally step up and do something about gun control,\" McCrickard said. \"Being a leader is about leading and making decisions that benefit, support and keep our country safe. How many times do we have to hear our leaders say, 'We're sorry' and 'Something must be done?' We demand action.\"\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper echoed Biden's sentiments following the shooting, saying the Raleigh community's pain is unimaginable.\n\n\"We're sad. We're angry and we want to know the answers to all the questions,\" the governor said. \"Those questions will be answered. Some today and more over time. But I think we all know the core truth: No neighborhood, no parent, no child, no grandparent, no one should feel this fear in their communities.\"\n\nCNN's Ray Sanchez, Justin Lear, Melissa Alonso, Dave Alsup, Paul P.

He said he screen-grabbed his location on a map and texted it to a friend. The phone died soon afterward.\n\nThe friend received the message and contacted the Coast Guard with the boaters' location.\n\nThe men didn't know it, but before the miraculous text message went through, the Coast Guard was already on their way, Lt.

But rough seas soon began disturbing their fishing boat, lapping water inside the vessel.\n\n\"The minute we saw the back of the boat start taking on water, I knew it right then and there,\" Phong Le told NBC's \"Today\" show on Wednesday. \"It was like the perfect storm for the perfect accident.\"\n\nThe front of the boat was tied to an oil rig, but the waves worsened, crashing aboard the boat. The men had about two minutes to react before their 24-foot center console boat sank around 10 a.m., according to an interview with \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nThe men quickly created an improvised raft, tying two ice chests together with Le's bandana.\n\n\"Every time I go fishing, I wear a bandana because I lose a hat every time,\" Le said.\n\nThey tried to propel themselves toward the oil rig to call for help.\n\n\"Every oil rig has some kind of foam, or something on there, so we figured we could get on there and we could make a distress call,\" Le said.

He wanted to swim about five miles to a shrimp boat and call for help, he told NBC. But when he got about a mile out, the shrimper left, he said.\n\nTrying to figure out his location, Le took out his cell phone, protected by a waterproof case - it had less than 5% battery and was in airplane mode to save the charge.\n\n\"I opened up my phone and that's when all of a sudden, all of the text messages came in,\" Le said. \"The whole time I didn't have no signal but out in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico, I had a signal.\"\n\nLe didn't waste time. He said he screen-grabbed his location on a map and texted it to a friend. The phone died soon afterward.\n\nThe friend received the message and contacted the Coast Guard with the boaters' location.\n\nThe men didn't know it, but before the miraculous text message went through, the Coast Guard was already on their way, Lt. Katy Caraway from Air Station New Orleans told CNN on Thursday. She was the co-pilot of a Jayhawk helicopter that helped rescue the men.\n\nFive minutes into their flight, Caraway said they got the radio transmission that there was new information they could use in the search. It took them 25 minutes to get to the location sent in the text message.\n\nAfter 15 to 20 minutes of searching the waters, a pilot from a Coast Guard airplane, cruising at an altitude of 1,000 feet, spotted one of the men waving from the water, Caraway said.\n\nA Coast Guard Jayhawk aircrew treats the rescued boaters for injuries.

Former subordinate recalls serving under Russia's new top commander in Ukraine | CNN", "body":"CNN --\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin's devastating war on Ukraine is faltering. Now, there's a new general in charge - with a reputation for brutality.\n\nAfter Ukraine recently recaptured more territory than Russia's army took in the last six months, Russia's Ministry of Defense last Saturday named Sergey Surovikin as its new overall commander for operations in the war.\n\nNotably, he previously played an instrumental role in Russia's operations in Syria - during which Russian combat aircraft caused widespread devastation in rebel-held areas - as Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Aerospace Forces.\n\nCNN spoke to a former Russian air force lieutenant, Gleb Irisov, who served under him in Syria.\n\nHe said Surovikin was \"very close to Putin's regime\" and \"never had any political ambitions, so always executed a plan exactly as the government wanted.\"\n\nAnalysts say Surovikin's appointment is highly unlikely to change how Russian forces are carrying out the war but that it speaks to Putin's dissatisfaction with previous command operations. It is also, in part, likely meant to \"mollify\" the nationalist and pro-war base within Russia itself, according to Mason Clark, Russia Lead at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think-tank.\n\nChechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who has called for Russia to \"take more drastic measures\" including the use of \"low-yield nuclear weapons\" in Ukraine following recent setbacks, welcomed the appointment of Surovikin, who first saw service in Afghanistan in the 1980s before commanding a unit in the Second Chechen War in 2004. Praise from Kadyrov, who is a key Putin ally, is significant, perhaps, as he himself is notorious for crushing all forms of dissent.\n\n\"I personally have known Sergei very well for almost 15 years. I can definitely say he is a real general and warrior, experienced, headstrong and foresighted commander who always takes patriotism, honor and respect above all,\" Kadyrov posted on social media, following news of Surovikin's appointment last Saturday. \"The united army group is now in safe hands,\" he added.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin meets with Russian Armed Forces service personnel who took part in operations in Syria, including Sergey Surovikin, at the Kremlin on December 28, 2017. President of Russia 'They hated him'\n\nIrisov, Surovikin's former subordinate, left his five-year career in the armed forces after his time in Syria because his own political views conflicted with what he experienced. \"Of course, you understand, who is right and who is wrong,\" Irisov said. \"I witnessed a lot of stuff, being inside the system.\"\n\nIrisov then began what he hoped would be the start of a career as an international journalist, as a military reporter with Russian state news agency TASS. His wife worked there and he felt at the time it was \"the only main information agency\" that tried to cover news in an \"unbiased\" way, with \"some opportunity of freedom of speech,\" he said.\n\nGleb Irisov is pictured at the beginning of his military career, during winter military training near Moscow, Russia. Gleb Irisov Gleb Irisov is pictured during his service with the Russian Air Force in Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave. Gleb Irisov\n\n\"Everything changed\" on February 24, 2022, when Putin's invasion of Ukraine began and TASS received orders from the FSB security service and defense ministry \"that everyone will be prosecuted if they don't execute the propaganda scheme,\" Irisov said.\n\nHe had family in Kyiv, hiding in bomb shelters, and told CNN he knew \"nothing could justify this war.\" He also knew from his military contacts that there were already many casualties in the first days of the war.\n\n\"For me it was obvious from the beginning,\" Irisov recalled. \"I tried to explain to people this war will lead to the collapse of Russia... it will be a great tragedy not only for Ukrainians but also for Russia.\"\n\nIrisov fled Moscow with his pregnant wife and young child on March 8, 2022, after standing against the invasion. He had quit his job at TASS and signed petitions and an open letter against the war, he told CNN. After traveling to Armenia, Georgia, Turkey and finally Mexico, where they contacted the US embassy to ask for help, they are now working to start a new life in West Virginia.\n\nGleb Irisov is pictured with his wife, Alisa Irisova, in the last photo taken before they left Russia by air for Armenia, in March 2022. Gleb Irisov\n\nWhile serving at Latakia air base in Syria in 2019 and 2020, the 31-year-old says he worked on aviation safety and air traffic control, coordinating flights with Damascus' civilian airlines. He says he saw Surovikin several times during some missions and spoke to high-ranking officers under him.\n\n\"He made a lot of people very angry - they hated him,\" Irisov said, describing how the \"direct\" and \"straight\" general was disliked at headquarters because of the way he tried to implement his infantry experience into the air force.\n\nIrisov says he understands Surovikin had strong connections with Kremlin-approved private military company the Wagner group, which has operated in Syria.\n\nThe Kremlin denies any connections to Wagner and insists that private military companies are illegal in Russia.\n\nAwarded 'hero' title\n\nSurovikin, whose military career began in 1983, has a checkered history, to say the least.\n\nIn 2004, according to Russian media accounts and at least two think tanks, he berated a subordinate so severely that the subordinate took his own life.\n\nAnd a book by the think tank the Washington DC-based Jamestown Foundation says that during the unsuccessful coup attempt against former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in August 1991, soldiers under Surovikin's command killed three protesters, leading to Surovikin spending at least six months in prison.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment on Surovikin's appointment and regarding allegations about his harsh leadership.\n\nIn a 2020 report, Human Rights Watch named him as \"someone who may bear command responsibility\" for the dozens of air and ground attacks on civilian objects and infrastructure in violation of the laws of war\" during the 2019-2020 Idlib offensive in Syria. The attacks killed at least 1,600 civilians and forced the displacement of an estimated 1.4 million people, according to HRW, which cites UN figures.\n\nVladimir Putin (left) toasts with then-Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev next to Sergey Surovikin after a ceremony to bestow state awards on military personnel who fought in Syria, on December 28, 2017. Kirill Kuryavtsev\/AFP\/Getty Images\n\nDuring his time in Syria, the now-56-year-old was awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation.\n\nIn February this year, Surovikin was sanctioned by the European Union in his capacity as head of the Aerospace Forces \"for actively supporting and implementing actions and policies that undermine and threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine as well as the stability or security in Ukraine.\"\n\nIrisov believes there are three reasons why he has been put in charge in Ukraine now: his closeness to the government and Putin; his interbranch experience with both the infantry and air force; and his experience since the summer commanding Russian forces in the southern Ukrainian regions of Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Crimea. These are areas that Putin is trying to control \"at any cost,\" said Irisov.\n\nJust two days after Surovikin's appointment on Saturday, Russia launched its heaviest bombardment of Ukraine since the early days of the war.\n\nSurovikin is \"more familiar with cruise missiles, maybe he used his connections and experience to organize this chain of devastating attacks,\" Irisov said, referencing the reports that cruise missiles have been among the weapons deployed by Russia in this latest surge of attacks.\n\nBut Clark, from the ISW, suggests the general's promotion is \"more of a framing thing to inject new blood into the Russian command system\" and \"put on this tough nationalist face.\"\n\nHis appointment \"got widespread praise from various Russian military bloggers as well as Yevgeny (Prigozhin), who's the financier of the Wagner Group,\" Clark said.\n\nHe believes what's happening now is a reflection of what happened in April, when another commander, Alexander Dvornikov, was appointed overall commander of the operations in Ukraine.\n\n\"Similarly, he before then was a commander of one of the groupings of Russian forces and had sort of a master reputation in Syria much like Surovikin for brutality, earning this sort of name of the 'butcher of Aleppo,'\" Clark said.\n\nDvornikov was also seen at the time as the commander \"that was going to turn things around in Ukraine and get the job done,\" he added. \"But an individual commander is not going to be able to change how tangled Russian command and control is at this point in the war, or the low morale of Russian forces.\"\n\nColonel General Sergey Surovikin, then-commander of the Russian forces in Syria, speaks at a briefing in the Russian Defense Ministry in Moscow, on June 9, 2017. Pavel Golovkin\/AP\n\nAndrea Kendall-Taylor, director of the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, also told CNN this week that Surovikin's appointment \"reflects the ascendancy of a lot of hardline voices inside Russia... calling on Putin to make changes, and to bring in someone who would be willing to execute these ruthless attacks.\"\n\nClark reasons that \"from what we've seen, it's highly probable that Putin is involved in decision-making down to a very tactical level and in some cases bypassing the senior Russian military officers to interact directly on the battlefield.\"\n\nSurovikin personally signed Irisov's resignation papers from the air force, he says. Now, Irisov sees him put in charge of operations in Putin's brutal war in Ukraine - but what impact the general will or can have is not yet clear.\n\nAccording to Clark, \"there isn't a good Kremlin option if Surovikin doesn't perform or if Putin decides that he is also not up to the task. There aren't many other senior Russian officers and it's just going to lead to a further degradation of the Russian war effort.\"", "source":{"uri":"edition.cnn.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"CNN International"}, "authors":[], "image":"https:\/\/media.cnn.com\/api\/v1\/images\/stellar\/prod\/221013115424-06-sergei-surovikin.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "eventUri":"eng-8096920", "sentiment":-0.4352941176470588, "wgt":403508340, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7225763028", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2022-10-15", "time":"05:01:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-15T05:01:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T04:10:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/travel\/article\/italy-tourists-bad-behavior\/index.html", "title":"Tourists in Italy are behaving badly this year: Here's why", "body":"Nope: Also in August, an Australian decided to ride his moped around the ancient Roman site of Pompeii, while in October, an American smashed two priceless sculptures in the Vatican Museum, apparently after being told that he could not see the pope.

Marco Ugarte\/AP\n\nThe Venezuelan migration crisis is more acute than ever. More than seven million Venezuelans now live abroad, according to new figures released this month by the United Nations, fleeing a humanitarian crisis in their home country.\n\nMost live in other South American countries - there are more than two million in Colombia alone -- but in recent months a growing number have started to head north to the US through Central America and Mexico, as living conditions deteriorate amid the Covid-19 pandemic and a global food crisis.\n\nAs a result, the number of Venezuelans apprehended at the US southern border is ballooning. Up to 180,000 Venezuelans have crossed the border over the past year, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nA disqualifying route\n\nPanama and Mexico form a geographical passageway for overland travelers coming from South America. Under the new US migration provision, any northbound migrant entering Panama or Mexico illegally will be ineligible from the program.\n\nThe journey that Morey, her husband Rodolfo and their three children planned would have been just that. They aimed to travel first to the town of Necocli in Colombia, and then hike into Panama via the Darien Gap, a 100-kilometer stretch of jungle that is impassable by road.\n\nDespite the myriad dangers, 150,000 migrants have crossed on foot so far this year, according to Panamanian authorities.\n\nMorey, who is currently in Colombia, says a return to Venezuela is impossible. In 2018 her family sold their home in Santa Teresa del Tuy, an impoverished town some 30 kilometers southeast of Caracas, for US$1500 to pay for the journey to Colombia.\n\nNow, she feels she's been thrown into limbo. Like so many others, she cannot afford to pay for a transcontinental flight -- much less for her entire family.\n\n\"Under these circumstances I have nowhere to go... I am scared: what can I do?\" Morey told CNN.\n\nHer situation is the norm for most of the migrants who are currently traveling north.\n\n\"After so much pain, so many obstacles we had to overcome, now we're stuck. We are in Necocli and have nowhere to go...\" a Venezuelan migrant who asked to be identified only as Jos\u00e9 told CNN.\n\nUp to 10,000 migrants are waiting in the town to cross the bay to the Darien Gap, according to local authorities, but some are now reconsidering their next move.\n\n\"I'm in pain, I don't know what to do now,\" says Ender Dairen, a 28-year-old Venezuelan who was planning to join a group travelling north from Ecuador. But his plans changed after speaking with other migrants online.\n\n\"A couple friends are thinking of just settling down wherever they got to, somewhere between Costa Rica and Nicaragua,\" he told CNN. \"Every person you speak with says the same thing: the whole route collapsed; we can no longer travel.\"\n\nYadimar, a migrant from Venezuela who was sent to Mexico under Title 42. Jose Luis Gonzalez\/Reuters A 'cruel' policy\n\nIn a call with reporters on Thursday, senior Homeland Security official Blas Nu\u00f1ez-Neto said the goal is to reduce the number of migrants approaching the US southern border illegally, and at the same time to create a legal pathway for those eligible.\n\nBut the plan drew rare criticism from members of the Venezuelan opposition, who are generally aligned with Washington in their struggle against Venezuela's authoritarian leader Nicolas Maduro.\n\n\"The US Government announced a cruel migratory policy, that makes the situation of thousands of Venezuelans more painful,\" tweeted Henrique Capriles, a two-time presidential candidate and one of the few anti-Maduro leaders still living in Caracas.\n\nCarlos Vecchio, the official representative of the Venezuelan opposition in Washington, also tweeted that the plan \"insufficient for the magnitude\" of Venezuela's migration crisis.\n\n\"We recognize @POTUS' efforts to seek alternatives to the migration crisis through Humanitarian Parole, for orderly and safe migration for Venezuelans,\" he said.\n\n\"But the 24,000 visas announced are insufficient for the magnitude of the problem. A reconsideration is necessary in this regard.\"\n\nThe Venezuelan government has not commented on the new US policy.\n\nBut humanitarian organizations, such as Doctors Without Borders (MSF), have echoed others' criticism that 24,000 legal permits are not enough -- and insist that expulsion of others to Mexico under Title 42 should not be permitted.\n\n\"We are shocked by the Biden administration's decision to start expelling Venezuelans under Title 42, a cruel and inhumane policy that has no basis in safeguarding public health that should have been ended long ago,\" said Avril Benoit, Executive director at MSF in a statement.\n\n\"While we welcome the rollout of a special humanitarian parole program for Venezuelans, ensuring safe pathways into the US should be the norm and not the exception.\"\n\nRights activists argue that asylum seekers should have a chance to present their cases in the US before being turned back.\n\nStill, some migrants say they see a glimmer of hope in the Biden administration's new stance.\n\nOscar Chacin, 44, a boxing instructor who had considered the idea of traveling to the US via Central America for weeks, told CNN that he now sees a legal pathway to migrate.\n\n\"For me, it's actually better. This will make things worse for so many people, but for me it's good,\" he said. \"I have relatives in the US, some friends and some former boxing students, some of them will be able to sponsor me and my family.\"\n\nHis son, Oscar Alexander, is already in Mexico and entered before the new US immigration rules were unveiled.\n\n\"He will stay there, now. He's already looking for a job, and we will present the documentation as soon as we find the sponsor,\" Chacin said.\n\n\"Then we will wait for the paperwork.

Tony Evers of Wisconsin and his Republican challenger, Tim Michels, clashed in a debate Friday night over the swing state's election administration, as Michels vowed to sign into law a series of restrictive voting measures that the incumbent has vetoed.\n\nThe stylistic differences between the two nominees were on display in Madison in their first and only debate.\n\nEvers demonstrated his technocratic approach, diving into detailed proposals to issue child care tax credits, share state government revenue with local governments, eliminate the \"minimum markup\" law that requires gas stations to charge at least 9% more than what they pay for gas, and reduce state income taxes for middle-class earners by 10%.\n\nMichels was much shorter on specifics, promising \"massive tax reform\" without offering details. Instead, he sought to portray Evers as a weak leader.\n\n\"I'm a businessman. I understand macroeconomics. I understand how to read a balance sheet,\" Michels said.\n\nThe outcome of Wisconsin's race for governor could have significant implications for the 2024 presidential election - a contest in which Wisconsin could reprise its role as a marquee swing state.\n\nHere are six takeaways from Friday's gubernatorial debate in the Badger State:\n\nA clash over election integrity\n\nEvers defended the integrity of Wisconsin's elections, saying Republicans were claiming massive fraud in the 2020 presidential election \"without having any idea or any specifics.\"\n\n\"It was safe, fair and we can have confidence in our election,\" Evers said.\n\nThe Democratic governor this year vetoed a series of bills approved by the GOP-led legislature that would have imposed new requirements on mail-in voting and new citizenship verification; required the state to deactivate more voter registrations; banned the use of private election grants; and shifted election oversight to the legislature.\n\nMichels mentioned \"Zucker bucks,\" a reference to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, donating $350 million to the Center for Tech and Civic Life to help election officials and voters safely navigate the coronavirus pandemic. He also said he would outlaw \"ballot harvesting,\" the practice of allowing another person to hand in a voter's absentee ballot.\n\nAnd he highlighted a judge's ruling this fall that led the Wisconsin Elections Commission to withdraw its guidance to clerks to fill in missing information on absentee ballot witness certificates.\n\n\"I will make sure that once I'm governor, we never have these questions again about election integrity. I will work with the legislature. We will get these bills right - the bills that Gov. Evers vetoed,\" Michels said.\n\nBoth nominees vow to certify elections\n\nEvers and Michels both said they would certify the next election in Wisconsin that takes place while they are governor.\n\nEvers said he would certify the outcome of the gubernatorial election \"no matter who wins.\"\n\n\"Of course, I will certify the next election,\" Michels said.\n\nBut Michels said the state also needs to address concerns about election security. The Republican has previously embraced former President Donald Trump's false claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election. While he did not promote those claims Friday, he also did not acknowledge that election security concerns exist as a result of Trump's lies.\n\n\"I want to make sure, after I'm governor, that we're not having these conversations two years from now, four years from now, and beyond,\" Michels said.\n\nA clear contrast on abortion rights\n\nMichels said Friday he is \"pro-life\" but would sign legislation that allows for exceptions for rape and incest to the state's 1849 abortion ban, which was allowed to take effect after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this summer. Wisconsin's GOP-led legislature has not yet advanced a measure to allow such exceptions.\n\nThe Republican also said he is \"not against contraception\" and downplayed the possibility of enforcing criminal penalties against those who seek abortions in other states.\n\n\"I'm a commonsense guy, and I've listened to the people, and I'll always listen to the people,\" Michels said.\n\nEvers has pushed state GOP lawmakers to support changing state law to allow for a statewide referendum on the 1849 ban. He recently called lawmakers into a special session urging them to allow citizens to put forth such a referendum, but the GOP-led Assembly and Senate both adjourned in less than 30 seconds without taking action.\n\nEvers on Friday described Michels as \"radical\" on the issue and said Wisconsin should return to the abortion rights protections that existed before Dobbs ruling.\n\n\"The bottom line here is this: Women should have the ability and the right to make decisions about their health care, including reproductive health care, and that includes abortion,\" Evers said.\n\nEvers backs gun control measures that Michels calls unconstitutional\n\nEvers and Michels also clashed over gun restrictions, with the governor saying he supports universal background checks and \"red flag\" laws and Michels responding that such laws were unconstitutional.\n\nAsked about violent crime in Milwaukee, Michels touted the time he has spent in the city and said many homicides there were a result of knife violence, rather than guns. He said he sees red flag laws as a \"slippery slope.\"\n\n\"With the millions of guns in Wisconsin, we need to make sure that the responsible gun owners are not going to be subject to having their guns taken away without due process,\" he said.\n\nEvers said his plan to combat gun violence includes sharing state revenue with local governments. He also advocated red flag laws and universal background checks, two gun restrictions that currently have no path forward in the GOP-dominated legislature.\n\n\"Responsible gun owners don't have to worry about red flag laws, because it will never be an issue for them,\" Evers said.\n\nMichels vows to 'be tough' on crime\n\nMichels hammered Evers over the Wisconsin parole commission's decisions to grant hundreds of discretionary paroles not required by law.\n\nThose paroles have been routine in the past, but Republicans in Wisconsin have blamed Democrats for increases in violent crime. The state saw a 70% increase in homicides from 2019 to 2021 - a trend that occurred across the nation and that experts say was driven by the coronavirus pandemic and economic factors.\n\nThe paroles, Michels said, showed Evers following through on his 2018 campaign pledge to cut the state's prison population in half.\n\n\"They released over 1,000 convicted felons. They have about 10,000 more to go if you do the simple math,\" Michels said. \"I will pick a chief parole commissioner who is going to make sure that we have rule of law in Wisconsin.\"\n\nEvers, meanwhile, pointed out that the parole commission is not controlled by the governor, though the governor does appoint its chair. Commission chair John Tate resigned under criticism in June, which Evers noted was at his urging.\n\n\"This is about shared revenue. We can talk about parole, but we also have all sorts of issues in the criminal justice system,\" Evers said.\n\nMichels shot back: \"You heard, more money, more resources, more resources, and it doesn't matter about leadership. ... I am going to be tough, and I am going to talk tough.\"\n\nCRT or the ABCs?\n\nEvers and Michels also sparred over education, an issue on which Michels supports allowing public dollars to follow students to private schools while Evers wants more funding for public schools.\n\n\"You would think that education will be going well under his leadership, but it's not. Something has to change,\" Michels said of Evers, who was the former chief education official in the state before he was governor.\n\nHe added: \"It can't get any worst. It will get better because we're going to empower parents, those tuition dollars are going to go with the parents of the sons and daughters. ... And we're going to stop the CRT and get back to the ABCs,\" Michels said, referring to critical race theory, a concept that has become politicized in recent years.\n\nEvers countered: \"CRTs are not taught in our schools. And the ABCs are.\"", "source":{"uri":"edition.cnn.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"CNN International"}, "authors":[{"uri":"eric_bradner@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Eric Bradner", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}, {"uri":"veronica_stracqualursi@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Veronica Stracqualursi", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/media.cnn.com\/api\/v1\/images\/stellar\/prod\/221014222420-01-6-takeaways-from-the-wisconsin-governors-debate.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "eventUri":"eng-8094356", "sentiment":0.1058823529411765, "wgt":403500300, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7225710496", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2022-10-15", "time":"03:25:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-15T03:25:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T03:04:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.7607843279838562, "url":"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2022\/10\/14\/entertainment\/bts-reunite-free-concert-south-korea-world-expo-intl-hnk\/index.html", "title":"BTS to reunite for free concert to support South Korea's World Expo bid | CNN", "body":"BTS perform onstage during the 64th Annual Grammy Awards.

Doctors are trying to save her but there (may be) no hope of survival,\" the girl's mother told CNN on Thursday.\n\nCNN is not naming the alleged victim or her mother to protect their identities.\n\nThe girl suffered burns to about 80% of her body, according to Dr. S.P. Singh, medical superintendent at the University of Medical Sciences, which is treating her.\n\n\"She is not out of danger yet,\" he said.\n\nOn average, India reports one rape every 17 minutes, according to the latest government figures, and campaigners say the girl's case highlights just how deeply entrenched misogynistic and patriarchal values are in the country of 1.3 billion.\n\nThe problem is exacerbated in rural India because women remain largely uneducated and stigma surrounding sexual assault runs rampant, they say.\n\n\"This case shows how young girls are still at great risk of of sexual violence,\" said Jayna Kothari, a senior advocate at India's Supreme Court. \"The fact is that these cases are becoming more violent because there is no accountability for the perpetrators. People continue such acts with impunity because there is no fear.\"\n\nThe alleged attack\n\nThe girl was allegedly raped about three months ago by her 18-year-old cousin, after which she became pregnant, according to Kamlesh Kumar Dixit, a senior police official in Uttar Pradesh, and the girl's mother.\n\nBut the girl did not tell her mother about the alleged attack, and instead, like many survivors of sexual assault, lived in silence.\n\nWhen her mother eventually learned of the pregnancy, she agreed to marry the victim to her alleged attacker.\n\n\"My sister-in-law (the alleged rapist's mother) said they would pay for an abortion and get them married. Since we belong to the same family, we settled the matter,\" said the girl's mother, adding she now wants the alleged rapist to be hanged.\n\nKamlesh Kumar Dixit, a senior police official in Uttar Pradesh, said the alleged rapist and his mother were arrested on Monday on suspicion of attempted murder after they allegedly poured kerosene on the girl and set her on fire. Devendra Singh Chauhan for CNN\n\nThe idea of a victim marrying her alleged rapist is not unheard of in India, where sexual assault and pregnancy out of wedlock are viewed with a \"deep sense of shame and stigma,\" according to Kothari, the lawyer.\n\n\"It's hard to change these regressive attitudes,\" she said. \"Girls are seen as a burden. She would have faced violence and her family would have faced violence, so the family would have wanted to marry her off.\"\n\nBut when the girl went to her alleged rapist's house on the pretext of getting married on October 6, he and and his mother allegedly poured kerosene on her and set her alight, Dixit said.\n\nThe motive for the alleged attack remains unclear. Police have said they are investigating.\n\nThe victim's home is in a low-income neighborhood in the city of Mainpuri in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state. Tea, fruit and snack stalls line the muddy sidewalk, while rickshaws and motorcycles run amok on the uneven roads. Goats and cows graze on scraps of food in the distance.\n\nThe girl is from a low-income neighborhood in Mainpuri in India's most populous state. Devendra Singh Chauhan for CNN\n\nIf Uttar Pradesh were a country, it would be the world's fifth largest with a population of more than 200 million.\n\nThe state is a key target for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's \"Beti Bachao Beti Padhao\" (Save the Girl Educate the Girl) campaign, aimed at improving gender equality in the country. But the campaign seems to have had little impact and horrific acts of violence have made frequent headlines.\n\nActivist Yogita Bhayana said said many men still see rape as an \"act of power\" over women, and most of the time, the violence goes unreported out of fear.\n\nIn December 2019, a woman died in the state after she was set on fire as she traveled to testify at the trial of two men accused of raping her - highlighting the dangers sexual assault survivors face by speaking out.\n\n\"When women go to the authorities, they can face even more harm,\" Kothari said. \"Instead of justice running its course, they are faced with more violence.\"\n\nShame, secrecy and a legal backlog\n\nThe alleged involvement of a woman in this case demonstrates the scale of internalized misogyny in society, campaigners say - and it is not the first time something like this has happened.\n\nIn January this year, a woman's hair was cut off and her face painted black before she was paraded along a street in India's capital Delhi, where some people in a crowd called for her to be raped. Most of the baying mob were women.\n\nWomen are taught to uphold patriarchal values from a young age, activists say. And despite the government's various attempts to strengthen India's rape laws, it has done little to stem the level of sexual violence in the country, which was ranked the most dangerous place in the world to be a woman in a 2018 Thompson Reuters Foundation survey of experts on women's issues.\n\nThe problem persists because of societal issues, which remain harder to change, activists say, as victims are often taught they are ultimately to blame for any wrongdoing.\n\nMoreover, India's justice system is \"notoriously slow\" and can be \"traumatic\" for the victim of assault, according to Kothari, the lawyer.\n\nIn 2019, the central government approved a plan to open more than 1,000 fast-track courts across India to help clear a backlog of rape cases and sexual offenses against minors.\n\nHowever, according to data submitted by the minister of law and justice in the upper house of Parliament in December 2021, fewer than 700 such courts had been established.\n\n\"The process is so punishing for women,\" Kothari said. \"Even though they are victims, they can end up being vilified in police stations and in the court rooms.\"", "source":{"uri":"edition.cnn.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"CNN International"}, "authors":[{"uri":"rhea_mogul@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Rhea Mogul", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/media.cnn.com\/api\/v1\/images\/stellar\/prod\/221014210835-02-india-teen.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "eventUri":"eng-8097327", "sentiment":-0.2862745098039216, "wgt":403497360, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7225676738", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2022-10-15", "time":"02:21:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-15T02:21:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T02:12:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.8588235378265381, "url":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2022\/10\/15\/series-of-earthquakes-rattle-hawaii-amid-mauna-loa-volcano-unrest", "title":"Series of earthquakes rattle Hawaii amid Mauna Loa volcano unrest", "body":"Mauna Loa is the largest active volcano on the planet and is in a \"state of heightened unrest\", scientists say.\n\nA magnitude 5.0 earthquake was the strongest of a series of temblors that have struck Hawaii's Mauna Loa, the largest active volcano on the planet, which scientists say is in a \"state of heightened unrest\".\n\nA series of earthquakes on Friday started with a 4.6 magnitude earthquake 24 seconds before the larger 5.0 earthquake, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said in a statement issued by the United States Geological Survey (USGS).\n\n\"The two larger earthquakes were reported by hundreds of people from the Island of Hawai'i and felt to a lesser extent across the entire State of Hawai'i,\" the observatory said.\n\n\"Shaking from the larger earthquakes may have been strong enough to do minor local damage, especially to older buildings,\" it said.\n\nEarthquakes have preceded previous eruptions of Mauna Loa, though they have generally been larger than the quakes experienced on Friday, the observatory said.\n\n\"There has been no immediate effect on the continuing unrest beneath Mauna Loa summit, which remains elevated at levels similar to the past week,\" the observatory added.\n\nHawaii County Mayor Mitch Roth said there were no immediate reports of major damage or injuries.

The footage, obtained exclusively by CNN, shows in vivid new detail how congressional leaders fled the US Capitol on January 6 and transformed a nearby military base into a command center, where they frantically coordinated with Vice President Mike Pence and Trump Cabinet members to quell the insurrection and finish certifying the 2020 election.\u202fThe footage was captured by Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker and daughter of the Democratic speaker of the House.\n\nIt has been known since January\u202f6, 2021, that\u202fcongressional leaders from both parties were hastily evacuated to Fort McNair, which is about two miles south of the Capitol.

There is no suggestion of legal wrongdoing.\n\nIn a statement, Fair Fight PAC said it \"became aware that PAC funds may have been incorrectly paid to consultants\" a day earlier and that it would immediately begin its probe.\n\n\"Our first priority is to organize collective efforts to educate voters, which we will not lose sight of throughout this internal investigation,\" the group said. \"Fair Fight values transparency and accountability and will face any potential missteps head on.\"\n\nThe disclosure comes in the final stretch Abrams' rematch with Republican Brian Kemp, who defeated her to become governor in a close 2018 contest that, both during and after the campaign, saw Abrams raise questions over the integrity of the state's voting laws and Kemp's decision to stay on as its secretary of state while running for higher office. When Abrams acknowledged defeat following a brief court battle, she also announced the launch of Fair Fight.\n\nTwo years later, Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump by fewer than 12,000 votes statewide, becoming the first Democrat since Bill Clinton nearly three decades earlier to win Georgia in a presidential race. In January 2021, Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff defeated a pair of incumbent Republican senators in a runoff to deliver their party control of the US Senate. Warnock is up for re-election in November.\n\nFair Fight PAC, which was established in 2019, is an offshoot of Fair Fight Action, the non-profit organization doing advocacy work in Georgia. Its PAC works with Democrats around the country and supports political candidates.\n\nThe Abrams campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAccording to the Fox News report, the Fair Fight PAC paid more than $178,000 combined to the three individuals.

The Biden administration, which released a preview of the application Tuesday, aims to deliver debt relief worth up to $20,000 to millions of borrowers before federal student loan payments resume in January after a nearly three-year, pandemic-related pause.\n\nThe motion for a preliminary injunction was heard by District Judge Henry Edward Autrey, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in a federal court in Missouri by state attorneys general from Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska and South Carolina, as well as legal representatives from Iowa.\n\nOne of the judge's first questions during the hearing was about whether the states have standing to bring the case against the President. He likened standing, a legal threshold to bring a case, to baking a cake.\n\n\"You can have all the ingredients for a cake. But it's hard to make a cake if you don't have a pan to put the cake in. The pan is the standing,\" Autrey said.\n\nAfter hearing from the lawyers for both parties, Autrey declared a recess and told the attorneys they would hear from him soon.\n\nThe states argued in court documents that the Biden administration does not have the legal authority to grant broad student loan forgiveness. The states also argue that the policy would hurt them financially, as well as the revenues of a student loan servicer based in Missouri known as MOHELA.\n\nThe loan forgiveness policy creates an incentive for borrowers to consolidate Federal Family Education Loans owned by MOHELA into Direct Loans owned by the government, \"depriving them (MOHELA) of the ongoing revenue it earns from servicing those loans,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nOn the same day the lawsuit was filed, the Department of Education changed its policy so that borrowers whose federal student loans are guaranteed by the government but held by private lenders - including those made by the former Federal Family Education Loan program - were no longer eligible for debt relief.\n\nIn a court document, lawyers for the government argue that Congress gave the secretary of education the power to discharge debt in a 2003 law known as the HEROES Act. They also argue that the plaintiffs don't have standing to ask for an injunction.\n\nTo win a preliminary injunction, the states are required to demonstrate that the student loan forgiveness policy will cause them irreparable harm if the injunction is not implemented.\n\nThe last-minute policy change to exclude the FFEL borrowers could weaken the states' lawsuit.\n\n\"I think the government's move to cut off the path to debt relief for people whose student loans aren't held by the federal government undercut much of the standing in this case,\" said Abby Shafroth, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.\n\nThe losing party could immediately appeal the judge's Wednesday ruling on the injunction, sending the case to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, where it is likely to face a panel of conservative judges.\n\nThe Biden administration is also facing several other lawsuits over the student loan forgiveness policy. Two of the lawsuits have already been dismissed. One ongoing lawsuit was filed by Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, and another was filed this week by a conservative group, the Job Creators Network Foundation, on behalf of two student loan borrowers in Texas who do not qualify for the full $20,000 in debt relief under Biden's program.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "source":{"uri":"edition.cnn.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"CNN International"}, "authors":[{"uri":"katie_lobosco@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Katie Lobosco", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/media.cnn.com\/api\/v1\/images\/stellar\/prod\/221011152358-college-diplomas-stock.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":0.09019607843137245, "wgt":403492320, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7225641763", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2022-10-15", "time":"01:12:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-15T01:12:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T00:05:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.6549019813537598, "url":"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2022\/10\/14\/politics\/student-loan-forgiveness-beta-site\/index.html", "title":"Student loan forgiveness applications now open through beta mode website, Biden administration says | CNN Politics", "body":"CNN --\n\nThe Biden administration has opened the application process for Americans seeking student debt relief in a beta period starting Friday evening, officials told CNN, allowing applicants to begin signing up before the website is formally unveiled later this month.\n\nIn August, President Joe Biden announced his decision to cancel up to $10,000 in student loan debt for individuals making less than $125,000 a year or as much as $20,000 for eligible borrowers who were also Pell Grant recipients.\n\n\"Tonight, the Department of Education will begin beta testing the student debt relief website.

But the footage backs up the testimony of \u202fTrump White House official Cassidy Hutchinson, who told the January 6 committee about Trump's attempts to force his security detail to take him to the Capitol, but they overruled him.\n\nPelosi responds to the news with a straight face, telling nearby aides: \"If he comes, I'm going to punch him out. I've been waiting for this. For trespassing on the Capitol grounds, I'm going to punch him out. And I'm going to go to jail, and I'm going to be happy.\"\n\nLater in the clip, Pelosi can be seen saying \"we have got to finish the proceedings or else they will have a complete victory,\" a reference to how lawmakers wanted to finish certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election and Joe Biden's win after the pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol.\n\nPence works to relay information to Hill leaders\n\nThis clip shows Pelosi on the phone with Vice President Mike Pence, who says he is at the Capitol building.

When Schumer hears what Pence has to say, he responds emphatically by saying, \"Good news!\"\n\n\"They have thousands of law enforcement on the campus and they're confident they can secure the campus for reconvening so, I hope that's helpful,\" Pence says.

With an average annual growth rate of 6.7% since 2012, China has seen one of the fastest sustained expansions for a major economy in history. In 2021, its GDP hit nearly $18 trillion, constituting 18.4% of the global economy, according to the World Bank.\n\nChina's rapid technological advances have also made it a strategic threat to the United States and its allies. It's steadily pushing American rivals out of long-held leadership positions in sectors ranging from 5G technology to artificial intelligence.\n\nUntil recently, some economists were predicting that China would become the world's biggest economy by 2030, unseating the United States. Now, the situation looks much less promising.\n\nAs Xi prepares for his second decade in power, he faces mounting economic challenges, including an unhappy middle-class. If he is not able to bring the economy back on track, China faces slowing innovation and productivity, along with rising social discontent.\n\n\"For 30 years, China was on a path that gave people great hope,\" said Doug Guthrie, the director of China Initiatives at Arizona State University's Thunderbird School of Global Management, adding that the country is \"in deep trouble right now.\"\n\nHostesses stand near images showing Chinese President Xi Jinping at an exhibition highlighting Xi's years as leader, as part of the upcoming 20th Party Congress, on October 12, 2022 in Beijing, China. Kevin Frayer\/Getty Images Economic slowdown and rare dissent\n\nWhile Xi is one of the most powerful leaders China and its ruling Communist Party have seen, some experts say that he can't claim credit for the country's astonishing progress.\n\n\"Xi's leadership is not causal for China's economic rise,\" said Sonja Opper, a professor at Bocconi University in Italy who studies China's economy. \"Xi was able to capitalize on an ongoing entrepreneurial movement and rapid development of a private [sector] economy prior leaders had unleashed,\" she added.\n\nRather, in recent years, Xi's policies have caused some massive headaches in China.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping waves as he arrives for a reception at the Great Hall of the People on the eve of the Chinese National Day in Beijing, China September 30, 2022. Florence Lo\/Reuters\n\nA sweeping crackdown by Beijing on the country's private sector, that began in late 2020, and its unwavering commitment to a zero-Covid policy, have hit the economy and job market hard.\n\n\"If anything, Xi's leadership may have dampened some of the country's growth dynamic,\" Opper said.\n\nMore than $1 trillion has been wiped off the market value of Alibaba and Tencent -- the crown jewels of China's tech industry -- over the last two years. Sales growth in the sector has slowed, and tens of thousands of employees have been laid off, leading to record youth unemployment.\n\nThe property sector has also been bludgeoned, hitting some of the country's biggest home developers. The collapse in real estate -- which accounts for as much as 30% of GDP -- has triggered widespread and rare dissent among the middle class.\n\nThousands of angry homebuyers refused to pay their mortgages on stalled projects, fueling fears of systemic financial risks and forcing authorities to pressure banks and developers to defuse the unrest. That wasn't the only demonstration of discontent this year.\n\nIn July, Chinese authorities violently dispersed a peaceful protest by hundreds of depositors, who were demanding their life savings back from rural banks that had frozen millions of dollars worth of deposits. The banking scandal not only threatened the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of customers but also highlighted the deteriorating financial health of China's smaller banks.\n\n\"Many middle-class people are disappointed in the recent economic performance and disillusioned with Xi's rule,\" said David Dollar, a senior fellow in the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution.\n\nAccording to analysts, the vulnerabilities in the financial system are a result of the country's unfettered debt-fuelled expansion in the previous decade, and the model needs to change.\n\n\"China's growth during Xi's decade in power is attributable mainly to the general economic approach adopted by his predecessors, which focused on rapid expansion through investment, manufacturing, and trade,\" said Neil Thomas, a senior analyst for China and Northeast Asia at Eurasia Group.\n\n\"But this model had reached a point of significantly diminishing returns and was increasing economic inequality, financial debt, and environmental damage,\" he said.\n\nA new model is needed\n\nWhile Xi is trying to change that model, he is not going about it the right way, experts said, and is risking the future of China's businesses with tighter state controls.\n\nThe 69-year old leader launched his crackdown to rein in the \"disorderly\" private businesses that were growing too powerful. He also wants to redistribute wealth in the society, under his \"common prosperity\" goal.\n\nXi hopes for a \"new normal,\" where consumption and services become more important drivers of expansion than investments and exports.\n\nBut, so far, these measures have pushed the Chinese economy into one of its worst economic crises in four decades.\n\nShoppers walk through Taikoo Li Village Mall in Sanlitun in Beijing, China, on Monday, May 30, 2022. Bloomberg\/Getty Images\n\nThe International Monetary Fund recently cut its forecast for China's growth to 3.2% this year, representing a sharp slowdown from 8.1% in 2021. That would be the country's second lowest growth rate in 46 years, better only than 2020 when the initial coronavirus outbreak pummeled the economy.\n\nUnder Xi, China has not only become more insular, but has also seen the fraying of US-China relations. His refusal to condemn Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, and China's recent aggression towards Taiwan, could alienate the country even further from Washington and its allies.\n\nWhat are Xi's options?\n\nAnalysts say the current problems don't yet pose a major threat to Xi's rule. He is expected to secure an unprecedented third term in power at the Communist Party Congress that begins on Sunday. Priorities presented at the congress will also set China's trajectory for the next five years or even longer.\n\n\"It would likely take an economic catastrophe on the scale of the Great Depression to create levels of social discontent and popular protest that might pose a threat to Communist Party rule,\" said Thomas from Eurasia Group.\n\n\"Moreover, growth is not the only source of legitimacy and support for the Communist Party, and Xi has increasingly burnished the Communist Party's nationalist credentials to appeal to patriotism as well as pocketbooks,\" he added.\n\nBut to get China back to high growth and innovation, Xi may have to bring back market-oriented reforms.\n\n\"If he was smart, he would liberalize things quickly in his third term,\" said Guthrie.", "source":{"uri":"edition.cnn.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"CNN International"}, "authors":[{"uri":"laura_he@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Laura He", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/media.cnn.com\/api\/v1\/images\/stellar\/prod\/221013132227-xi-jinping-093022.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "eventUri":"eng-8103414", "sentiment":0.1450980392156862, "wgt":403490160, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7225622668", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2022-10-15", "time":"00:31:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-15T00:31:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-15T00:08:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0, "url":"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2022\/10\/14\/entertainment\/halloween-movies-to-watch\/index.html", "title":"Spooky movies to get you in the Halloween spirit | CNN", "body":"CNN --\n\nHalloween entertainment is serving major nostalgia this year, with some of our favorite spooky classics being remade, or better yet, getting a sequel.\n\nCheck out these holiday classics that will certainly leave you a little frightened.\n\n\"Hocus Pocus 2\"\n\nThe Sanderson Sisters are back! \"Hocus Pocus 2\" brings back Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy as your favorite witches to get you ready for Halloween.

In China, provisional death sentences can be commuted to a life term depending on the convict's behaviour in the first two years after the verdict.\n\nSun's conviction marks the possible end of an intensified anti-corruption campaign that targeted Sun's \"political clique\". It involved high-ranking officials such as Fu Zhenghua, former minister of justice, Wang Like, the former head of the political and legal affairs in eastern Jiangsu province, and three former police chiefs. Liu Yanping, the former chief of the disciplinary inspection commission, has also been indicted on corruption charges.\n\nAs Xi prepares for the twice-a-decade congress, which starts on October 16, the position of the man whose appointment was heralded by a headline-grabbing murder-corruption scandal involving his main adversary Bo Xilai, is stronger than ever.\n\n\"The recently announced prison sentences indicate that Xi is tying up loose ends before the party congress,\" Bruce Dickson, a professor at George Washington University whose research and teaching focus on China's political dynamics, told Al Jazeera. \"For those who have speculated there is opposition to Xi's leadership, these sentences make it clear he is firmly in charge.\"\n\nAccording to Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), which ranks countries based on perceived levels of public sector corruption, China scored 45 out of 100 in 2021, the average for the Asia Pacific region.\n\nTransparency said China's score had improved by nine points since 2014 \"in line with President Xi Jinping's strong anti-corruption rhetoric\", noting that Xi had \"reinforced top down controls and clamped down on some of the most brazen forms of corruption\".\n\nFrom 2014 to 2021, nearly 10,000 people who were suspected of corruption and fled abroad to avoid prosecution were brought back to China, and more than 20 billion yuan (about $2.9bn) of their illicit gains were retrieved, according to Xinhua, China's state news agency.\n\nSince Xi ascended to the presidency and rolled out his anti-corruption campaign, at least 4.4 million people have been investigated in graft-related cases, according to Zero Tolerance - a documentary on the party's anti-corruption efforts, sponsored by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), China's top corruption investigation body.\n\nAll party members and government officials are fair game for inspection: the phrase \"tigers and flies,\" hailed by Xi, refers to the highest-ranking government officials, the lowliest civil servants, and anyone in between.\n\nSun is far from the only top official to be caught in the crackdown.\n\nZhou Yongkang, for example, a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee, China's highest level of government leadership, was sentenced to life in prison in 2014. He was the first person in such a senior position to be investigated for corruption.\n\nBut the relentless crackdown has also raised questions about Xi's motivations.\n\nWhile some believe that Xi's personal investment in the issue stems from a genuine desire to tackle the problem of corruption, others argue the president is simply using it as a pretext to cement his authority over the party, removing those seen as disloyal or as potential rivals.\n\n\"The anti-corruption drive, despite its promising rhetoric, is about rescuing the party and restoring public faith more than eradicating corruption,\" said Samson Yuen, programme director in Government and International Studies at Hong Kong Baptist University. \"After all, corruption has been intertwined in complex ways with China's economic development.\"\n\nSome Chinese citizens told Al Jazeera they supported Xi's crackdown on corruption.\n\nOne Beijing resident, who preferred to be addressed only by his family name, Xu, said that at the beginning he was sceptical. \"New broom sweeps clean: of course, we all thought he was just saying these things (cracking down on corruption) and wasn't going to follow through,\" he said.\n\nNow, he describes Xi's clampdown on corruption as \"necessary\" and \"nothing but good\".\n\n\"I remember back in the days, corrupt officials were everywhere, and nothing got done by the government,\" Xu said. \"But ever since Xi Dada (an endearing form of address for the Chinese president) became the leader, corruption cannot stand a chance in China any more.\"\n\nPublic approval has helped ease the way for Xi's third term as president, which required an amendment to the constitution.\n\nZhao Shengzhao, a resident of Chongqing, the former stronghold of disgraced Bo, said that she would not mind Xi remaining in the top position for a further five years.\n\n\"If someone is this good at getting rid of corruption, then why do we need another person to replace him?\" she asked.\n\nA similar narrative has been carefully tailored in state propaganda. From party education to social media, the Communist Party has been arguing that unless corruption is tackled, economic inequality will remain, and that Xi is the only person who is up to the task.\n\nBut 10 years after Xi first became president, corruption remains rampant and many wonder how much longer the president can continue with the campaign.\n\n\"The continued revelation of corruption reflects how widespread the problem is, how difficult it is to fully root it out, and how determined Xi is to use this mechanism to solidify his control over the CCP,\" said George Washington University's Dickson.", "source":{"uri":"aljazeera.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors":[{"uri":"shawn_yuan@aljazeera.com", "name":"Shawn Yuan", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/000_32LB4CH.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440", "eventUri":null, "sentiment":0.0117647058823529, "wgt":403488180, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7225593269", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2022-10-14", "time":"23:35:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-14T23:35:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-14T23:00:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.6431372761726379, "url":"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2022\/10\/14\/politics\/latino-voters-texas-15th\/index.html", "title":"The Latino voter shift comes into focus in South Texas | CNN Politics", "body":"CNN --\n\nWhat first appeared as statistical noise is now becoming clearer: Historically left-leaning Latino voters are shifting toward the GOP, with the potential to swing major races come November's midterm elections.\n\nAnd with razor-thin margins determining control of Congress, Hispanic communities where Donald Trump unexpectedly made gains in 2020 are coming into sharp focus, especially the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas.\n\nHere, the battle for Texas's 15th Congressional District between Republican Monica De La Cruz and Democrat Michelle Vallejo is arguably the state's most competitive House race and may be a test for Republicans' appeal among Hispanic Americans.\n\nHispanic Americans make up a fifth of registered voters in more than a dozen hotly contested House and Senate races in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Texas. While Democrats are still expected to win a majority of Latino voters, their margins appear to be shrinking - dramatically, in some cases.\n\n\"What we're seeing now is that the GOP has stepped in and helped us get our messaging out to show Latinos their values of faith, family and freedom really align with the Republican Party,\" De La Cruz said\n\nVallejo argues that the shift is tied to an increase in outside spending by the GOP: \"I think the resources and money they're getting from the outside really does add fuel to their fire. ... It's not deeply connected with the desire from the community to drive up and bring solutions that are specifically from South Texas.\"\n\nInspired by Trump\n\nFor De La Cruz, attending her first Trump rally inspired her to start a career in politics.\n\n\"I was busy raising a family, raising my business,\" De La Cruz said. \"(Trump) caught my attention to look at national politics and what was happening in DC and say, 'Those policies don't reflect me or my values.'\"\n\nThe entrepreneur insurance agent and mother of two says she's a former Democrat whose family voted against Republicans for generations, including her \"abuelita.\"\n\n\"This area had been under Democrat rule for over 100 years and what we're seeing here is that Democrats haven't done anything for us. ... (They) just abandoned Latinos and Latinos are seeing that their values of faith, family and freedom just align better with the Republican Party.\"\n\nPart of a trio of Latina Republican congressional nominees on the ballot in South Texas, De La Cruz is attempting to redefine the region's political tradition alongside Cassy Garcia, a former Ted Cruz aide who is running in the 28th District, and US Rep. Mayra Flores in Texas' 34th who became the party's first representative from the Rio Grande Valley in more than a century after winning a special election earlier this year.\n\nThe \"triple threat,\" as some Republicans call them, are part of a record number of Republican Latino nominees this fall, with many taking a page from Trump's pro-border wall playbook.\n\nAsked whether she ever felt insulted by Trump's rhetoric toward Latino immigrants (\"They are bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists,\" the then-candidate said when announcing his first presidential run in 2016), De La Cruz, the granddaughter of Mexican immigrants, said his words didn't turn her away.\n\n\"Honestly, I probably wouldn't have said things the way he said them, but I think people were able to look past those things because they knew he's not a politician. He didn't have a political background. He was a businessman,\" said De La Cruz. \"He stood up against the establishment and put forth policies that worked for American families.\"\n\n'More attention and more respect'\n\nLike her GOP opponent, Vallejo, the Democrat running in Texas' 15th, is a relatively new to politics and an entrepreneur. She operates the Pulga Los Portales flea market in Alton, which her parents founded some 25 years ago.\n\n\"Our community deserves more attention and more respect,\" Vallejo said of the newly drawn district, which would have voted for Trump by nearly 3 percentage points in 2020. \"I think that both national parties were leaving us out.\"\n\nVallejo said Republicans have \"demonized\" Latino immigrants to score political points.\n\n\"We have pride and dignity and we will not stand for anyone making fun of us, making fun of our community and our culture. We're deserving and we give a lot back to this country,\" she said.\n\nRunning as a progressive in an area that more often elects moderate Democrats, Vallejo defeated her primary opponent by only 35 votes and is campaigning on guaranteed abortion rights, expanding Medicaid and Medicare, and raising the minimum wage to $15.\n\n\"There are a lot of issues being ignored,\" Vallejo said. \"It's time we see a change for South Texas, and we need progressive, bold policies ... so that we finally get a voice at the table.\"\n\nVallejo points to outside influence and spending to account for the GOP's gains in the area, saying, \"Outside interests did see an opportunity to swoop in, pouring millions and millions of dollars to pretty much buy up our seat.\"\n\nAs for Latinos who drifted from Democrats to support Trump, Vallejo said she \"looks forward to hopefully earning their support.\"\n\n\"I'm fighting for all our families here in South Texas, whether they're Republican, independent or people who have never felt engaged by the political system before,\" she said.\n\nCentral issues\n\nPolling indicates that Latino voters are more likely than any other ethnic groups to cite the economy or inflation as the most important issue facing the country. But other issues, such as immigration and abortion, also loom large.\n\n\"It's become so difficult. ... Supply chain issues are a big problem. And inflation - we used to pay $19 for a box of eggs. Now, I pay $54,\" said Rodolfo Sanchez-Rendon, the owner of Teresita's Kitchen in McAllen.\n\nSanchez-Rendon also faults Democrats for undervaluing faith, family and small business.\n\n\"Their values have changed,\" he said. \"Extremely liberal, where religion becomes an afterthought. ... They've drifted from our values.\"\n\nBut the economy remains the most important issue to voters like Sanchez-Rendon, who immigrated to the United States in 1986 and said unchecked illegal immigration is out of control across the southern border.\n\nContractor Edgar Gallegos said he plans to vote Republican because of the economy, despite Trump's rhetoric about Latino immigrants.\n\n\"I'll take a mean tweet right about now, over what we have,\" Gallegos said.\n\nOther voters, like Justin Stubbs, say they feel Democrats lack urgency on the issue of immigration.\n\n\"It seems like Republicans care and talk about the border issue a lot more. ... I just don't see a lot of Democrats talking about the border crisis and honestly, there's a lot of people down here that are affected by that,\" he said.\n\nOne voter in nearby Alton, Texas, said he and his wife will remain loyal to the Democratic Party because he believes it will do more to help the community.\n\n\"We want candidates who will pay attention to our needs,\" says Jose Raul Guerrero, who says he's voting for Vallejo partly because he's known her since she was a child. \"She understands our needs. ... and we need a lot of help right now.\"\n\n'The first Hispanic president'\n\n\"What people have to understand is that Hispanic Americans have hard working-class values,\" said Giancarlo Sopo, a former Barack Obama campaign worker who led Trump's hyper-local Hispanic advertising in 2020.\n\n\"Who's America's blue-collar billionaire? Donald Trump,\" he said.\n\nSopo said part of the Trump's campaign's success with Latinos was tied to an ad campaign that \"used words and ways of speaking\" that were unique to specific nationalities and generations, tailoring ads meant to target Puerto Ricans, for example, with slang and references common to the island.\n\n\"The reality is there are many Hispanic communities,\" Sopo says. \"You open the door with culture and engage Hispanics on a policy level.\"\n\nPointing to trends over the last decade that show Latinos experiencing gains when it comes to incomes, home purchases and starting new businesses, Sopo said many in the community view Trump aspirationally - adding that among some Latinos, especially men, the former President's brash rhetoric may have worked to his advantage.\n\n\"To a lot of Hispanic Americans - the same way that Bill Clinton was the first Black president before Barack Obama - Donald Trump, to them, is the first Hispanic president,\" Sopo said. \"He's very charismatic, he's not politically correct, he's a successful entrepreneur. ... These values really resonate.\"", "source":{"uri":"edition.cnn.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"CNN International"}, "authors":[{"uri":"boris_sanchez@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Boris Sanchez", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/media.cnn.com\/api\/v1\/images\/stellar\/prod\/221014172539-tx-vallejo-de-la-cruz-split.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "eventUri":"eng-8098771", "sentiment":0.2313725490196079, "wgt":403486500, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7225589637", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2022-10-14", "time":"23:29:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-14T23:29:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-14T23:01:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.6196078658103943, "url":"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2022\/10\/14\/politics\/georgia-senate-debate-takeaways\/index.html", "title":"Walker and Warnock debate in close Georgia Senate race | CNN Politics", "body":"CNN --\n\nOne of the closest and most contentious Senate races in the country could have its defining moment Friday night, as Democratic Sen.

Stop your engines!\", an officer screams. Powerful flashlights reveal a 32-foot, single-engine boat, crowded with immigrants -- some of them small children -- lying on the floor of the vessel. They are Venezuelan nationals, the Coast Guard later establishes. The footage was provided to CNN by the Colombian government.\n\nThis scene has been repeating itself with regularity around the Colombian San Andres Archipelago, located 775 kilometers (482 miles) northwest of mainland Colombia where the Colombian Coast Guard routinely intercepts boats loaded with migrants who pay smugglers to take them across the Caribbean.\n\nArriving in Central American countries like Nicaragua, the trip allows the migrants to avoid the perilous Darien Gap, a jungle region in Panama at the Colombian border that is also used by migrants trekking north with the hope of eventually reaching the United States.\n\nColombian Marine Corps Captain Octavio Guti\u00e9rrez, who serves in the San Andr\u00e9s Archipelago, says migrants fly into the islands where they spend a night or two as they try to get in touch with smugglers.\n\n\"Originally, [the smugglers] were charging between 1,000 and 1,500 dollars.

And the number of migrants trying to reach Central America has been steadily increasing.\n\nFrom South America to the United States, trying to stop yet another wave of migrants seems to be a losing battle. As CNN reported last month, US Customs and Border Protection encounters along the US-Mexico border have already topped 2 million so far this fiscal year, according to newly released agency data, with migration from authoritarian nations Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba driving numbers up.\n\nAnd many migrants' testimonies suggest, more than ever, they are willing to face any risk and pay ever increasing amounts of money to reach their American dream.\n\n'I'm making this sacrifice to give my children a better life'\n\nIn the span of just one week at the end of September, the Colombian Coast Guard detained 131 migrants, it told CNN. Though there were citizens from Cuba, Peru and Ecuador, most were Venezuelans, it said -- an observation echoed by migration officials in other transit countries, like Panama and Guatemala.\n\nMany are young men like Mario Mosquera and Jefferson Lozada, two Venezuelan cousins, whom CNN found walking along a highway in eastern Guatemala, told CNN that the country's crushing economic conditions had forced them out.\n\n\"Venezuela is unlivable. The economic crisis has been very hard, and the truth is that I'm making this sacrifice to give my children a better life,\" Mosquera, a married father of three, said.\n\n\"Minimum wage [in Venezuela] is not even enough for food. I left my country in search of a better future for me, for my mother and my siblings,\" Lozada said.\n\nAccording to a recent report by the New York-based humanitarian NGO International Rescue Committee, an estimated one-third of the population -- over 9 million people -- faced hunger in 2019. \"While data in Venezuela is often limited or missing entirely, this figure is likely growing; 14% of all children under age 5 in Venezuela suffer from global acute malnutrition; 57% of pregnant women are malnourished,\" it said.\n\nMario Mosquera and Jefferson Lozada, two Venezuelan cousins, walk along a highway in eastern Guatemala. CNN\n\nThe number of Venezuelans who have fled their country has already surpassed 7.1 million, according to the United Nations refugee agency. It surpasses countries like Ukraine (6.8 million) and Syria (6.6 million). These figures are striking because, unlike the other two nations, the South American country is not at war.\n\nIn Caracas, CNN spoke with another man who says he's desperate to get out of Venezuela and has already decided he will leave his country for the United States. He declined to reveal his identity because he works for the government of Venezuela.\n\nHis government job pays about five dollars a week, which forces him to hold two other jobs to make ends meet, he said.\n\n\"The real question is how to get to the United States,\" the 38-year-old added, saying that he has no visa for the United States, Mexico, or the Central American countries he would have to travel through.\n\nA man pushes a cart with pumpkins outside a public market in San Cristobal, Venezuela, April 7, 2022.

The morality police are a dedicated unit that enforces strict dress codes for women, such as wearing the compulsory headscarf.

In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month, Biden alluded to the protests over her death and said the US stood with the \"brave women of Iran who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights.\"\n\nDays later, the US announced sanctions on Iran's morality police \"for abuse and violence against Iranian women and the violation of the rights of peaceful Iranian protestors.\"\n\nBiden on Friday said, \"Women all over the world are being persecuted in various ways, but they should be able to wear in God's name what they wanna wear.

If there is a runoff this time around, it would be held four weeks after the general election, on December 6.\n\nAnd looking at polling in the race between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker, there looks to be a very real possibility that neither candidate winds up the winner on November 8.\n\nSurveys conducted over the last month have generally shown Warnock with a slight lead over Walker. The latest polls among likely voters from Fox News and Marist show Warnock below the 50% mark, while those from Quinnipiac University and CBS News\/YouGov put him just above that threshold.\n\nComplicating the math is the presence of Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver. In Marist's September poll, Oliver took 4%, compared to 47% for Warnock and 45% for Walker. (Another 4% were undecided.)\n\nAnd Oliver is reveling in his role as potential spoiler. \"If a run-off occurs, that means there's enough of the population that feels like both of the major party candidates or the top two candidates haven't been as responsive as they need to be,\" Oliver told Bloomberg recently. \"It's a lesson to them.\"\n\nConsider what the political world could look like if the Georgia Senate race went to a runoff.\n\nAt the moment, Democrats look slightly favored to win one Republican-held seat in Pennsylvania, where Lt. Gov. John Fetterman is running against Dr. Mehmet Oz. And conversely, Republicans feel good about their chances of flipping the Nevada Senate seat, where Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is facing former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt.\n\nThat could create a scenario where Georgia, once again, holds the key to control of the Senate majority. A month-long spending spree would commence, with every national group you can think of rushing into the state to try to influence the outcome. According to CNN's David Wright, about $233.4 million has been spent on ads in the Georgia Senate race, making it the most expensive contest of the midterms so far.\n\nThe Point: A runoff looks like a very real possibility in Georgia.

The Justice Department is asking the federal appeals court to invalidate Cannon's order and end the special master's review of documents.\n\n\"District courts have no general equitable authority to superintend federal criminal investigations,\" the brief said. \"[I]nstead, challenges to the government's use of the evidence recovered in a search are resolved through ordinary criminal motions practice if and when charges are filed. Here, however, the district court granted the extraordinary relief Plaintiff sought....\"\n\nThe Justice Department also argued that Trump had no basis to interfere with the review of executive branch documents by the Justice Department, which itself is part of the executive branch.\n\nPlus, department attorneys pointed out that Trump never made any claim of attorney-client privilege over the 11,000 documents taken from Mar-a-Lago in August that would have justified the appointment of a special master. The Justice Department argued that the filter procedures it has already employed were sufficient to shield any sensitive documents from investigators' review.\n\n\"[Trump] has no plausible claim of such a privilege with respect to the records bearing classification markings or any other government documents related to his official duties,\" the Justice Department brief said.\n\nRead the Justice Department's full brief\n\nThe federal appeals court granted the department's request last month to block certain aspects of an order from Cannon. This appeal contests the entire order from Cannon, who granted Trump's request to designate a third party to review the documents seized from his Florida estate.\n\nThe special master - Raymond Dearie, a senior federal judge based in Brooklyn - has already started the process for the review. If the department is ultimately successful in its appeal, the special master could be ordered to halt the review process.\n\nThis appeals process, however, will take at least several weeks. While a federal judge did grant the department's request to expedite the appeal, Trump's legal team still has until November 10 to file a response, and the 11th Circuit will not schedule oral arguments until after the department files a subsequent reply on November 17.\n\nAs it stands now, the special master's review must be complete by December 16, a timeline set into motion by Cannon, a Trump appointee.\n\nAfter the 11th Circuit stepped in last month to allow the Justice Department access to about 100 of the documents marked classified, Trump filed an emergency request asking the Supreme Court to intervene in that dispute. On Thursday, the high court refused his request.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision not to intervene means that, for now, the classified documents will stay out of the reach of the special master.\n\nThe department, in its Supreme Court filing, had argued that the 11th US Circuit found that Cannon \"abused her discretion\" and inflicted \"a serious and unwarranted intrusion on the Executive Branch's authority to control the use and distribution of extraordinarily sensitive government records.\"\n\nThe DOJ says the seized documents taken from Mar-a-Lago during the FBI search amount to 21,792 pages. The collection excludes materials seized by the FBI that have already been filtered out for privacy and the 100 documents marked as classified found in the search.\n\nThere's been a years-long pursuit from the National Archives and Records Administration, or NARA, to reclaim all records that belong to the federal government that were created during the Trump administration.\n\nNARA's back-and-forth with Trump and his liaisons led earlier this year to the return of boxes and envelopes full of records by former administration officials and lawyers. NARA's findings in one of those collections prompted a Justice Department investigation into the mishandling of classified records and August's search of Mar-a-Lago. NARA has said that certain presidential records from the Trump administration remain outstanding, citing information that some White House staff used non-official electronic systems to conduct official business.\n\nThe DOJ's appeal of the appointment of a special master comes days after CNN reported that a Trump employee told the FBI about being directed by the former President to move boxes out of a basement storage room to his residence at Mar-a-Lago - after Trump's legal team received a subpoena for any classified documents at the Florida estate.\n\nThe Trump employee initially denied handling sensitive documents or boxes at Mar-a-Lago, according to the source. But the FBI developed evidence that prompted investigators to go back to the witness, who revised their story to say Trump had given instructions to move the boxes, the source said.\n\nThe witness account of Trump's actions after the subpoena was served in May coupled with the footage could be key to the federal criminal investigation that's looking into a range of potential crimes, including obstruction, destruction of government records and mishandling of classified information.\n\nThe Department of Justice has previously alleged that classified documents at the resort were \"likely concealed and removed\" from a storage room at Mar-a-Lago as part of an effort to \"obstruct\" the FBI's investigation into Trump's potential mishandling of classified materials.\n\nThis is a breaking story and will be updated.\n\nCNN's Pamela Brown, Katelyn Polantz, Ariane de Vogue and Whitney Wild contributed to this report.", "source":{"uri":"edition.cnn.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"CNN International"}, "authors":[{"uri":"maegan_vazquez@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Maegan Vazquez", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}, {"uri":"jessica_schneider@edition.cnn.com", "name":"Jessica Schneider", "type":"author", "isAgency":false}], "image":"https:\/\/media.cnn.com\/api\/v1\/images\/stellar\/prod\/210209035327-doj-seal.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "eventUri":"eng-8093486", "sentiment":0.1529411764705881, "wgt":403480560, "relevance":1}, {"uri":"7225531692", "lang":"eng", "isDuplicate":false, "date":"2022-10-14", "time":"21:56:00", "dateTime":"2022-10-14T21:56:00Z", "dateTimePub":"2022-10-14T21:19:00Z", "dataType":"news", "sim":0.6313725709915161, "url":"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2022\/10\/14\/middleeast\/east-jerusalem-west-bank-clashes-intl\/index.html", "title":"East Jerusalem rocked by sixth night of clashes as Israeli raids in West Bank leave at least two Palestinians dead | CNN", "body":"Jerusalem CNN --\n\nClashes erupted in the flashpoint East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah and in the West Bank for a sixth consecutive night overnight Thursday into Friday, leaving at least two Palestinians dead.\n\nThey were killed in the restive West Bank city and refugee camp of Jenin during an Israeli raid on Friday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.\n\nIt named one man who died as \"colleague and doctor\" Abdullah Al-Ahmad, and said he died as a result of \"being hit by a bullet that pierced his head fired by occupation soldiers in front of Jenin Governmental Hospital this morning.\"\n\nPalestinian news agency Wafa named the other man who was killed as Mateen Dabaya, 20.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces is \"reviewing whether an uninvolved individual was hit and injured\" in the Jenin incident, IDF international spokesman Richard Hecht said on Twitter on Friday.\n\nAn Israeli Border Police officer talks to a Palestinian woman on October 14.

Milton was acquitted on another count of securities fraud.\n\nProsecutors had alleged that Milton made false and misleading statements about \"nearly all aspects of the business,\" including that Nikola had a fully functioning prototype despite Milton knowing it was inoperable.

It's unclear what caused the explosion, but Putin on Monday blamed it on Kyiv and called it a \"terrorist attack\" that could not be left unanswered.\n\nThe intense bombardment that followed over the next two days killed at least 19 people and leveled civilian targets across the country, drawing global outrage. The strikes also caused major damage to power systems across Ukraine, forcing people to reduce consumption during peak hours to avoid blackouts.\n\nPutin said that while he did not regret the strikes and believes that Russia's actions were correct, he did recognize that \"what is happening now is unpleasant.\"\n\nPutin also defended his partial mobilization of Russians that began in September, telling reporters it is expected to end in two weeks and that some 222,000 troops had already been drafted into the army.\n\nThe mobilization got off to a chaotic start last month, sparking rare protests throughout the country. Hundreds of thousands of people - mostly fighting-age men - fled Russia, pouring into neighboring countries like Georgia and Kazakhstan to avoid conscription.\n\nPutin also said that Russia does not seek to \"destroy\" Ukraine, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Western leaders have previously alleged. His comments come seven months after Russia launched a full-scale invasion and as Moscow attempts to annex four Ukrainian regions in violation of international law.\n\nThe Russian leader was speaking at a rare news conference in Astana, Kazakhstan, where Putin had traveled for a meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a regional intergovernmental organization made up of former Soviet states.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin speaks during the signing ceremony with separatist leaders in Moscow on September 30 Contributor\/Getty Images\n\nWhen asked if he would meet with US President Joe Biden, Putin told a reporter that he \"does not see the need for negotiations.\"\n\nBiden was asked a similar question in an exclusive interview with CNN earlier this week. The US President said he did not see \"any rationale\" for meeting his Russian counterpart, though he said he would perhaps make an exception to discuss the fate of imprisoned American basketball star Brittney Griner.\n\nRussian setbacks in Kherson\n\nRussian authorities said civilian evacuations would begin Friday in the occupied southern Ukrainian region of Kherson, where the Kremlin has suffered a string of defeats at the hands of Ukrainian forces.\n\nFurther to the east, Russia's embattled forces have managed to make some small gains in Donetsk, toward the city of Bakhmut, aided in large measure by Wagner mercenaries, or private military contractors. Moscow likely views the city a jumping-off point toward Kramatorsk and Sloviansk - the largest urban areas held by Ukraine in Donetsk, the British Defense Ministry said.\n\nBakhmut is currently under Ukrainian control, but it has been bombarded by Russian artillery for months. Reports from pro-Russian analysts and in Russian state media alleged that Kyiv had begun withdrawing some forces from the city, but CNN could not independently verify those claims. Ukrainian officials have not commented on them, but they have noted that Bakhmut is being fiercely contested.\n\nMeanwhile, the outlook for Russian forces in Kherson and the northeastern region of Luhansk remain bleak. Kyiv has continued to make significant gains along the western side of the Dnipro River, a major waterway that flows across Ukraine and Eastern Europe, as they push toward the city of Kherson.\n\nA man walks near anti-tank obstacles in the frontline town of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region on Tuesday. Yasuyoshi Chiba\/AFP\/Getty Images\n\nFighting near Kherson city continued to rage on Friday. Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the Russian-backed administration in Kherson, said Moscow's forces were \"courageously and professionally holding back the daily attempts of the militants of the Kyiv regime to break through the defenses.\"\n\nThough Stremousov said civilians should be at a \"safe distance from the hostilities\" and that Kherson residents appeared to have begun evacuating. The governor of the eastern Russian region of Rostov, Vasily Golubev, said Thursday that local authorities were preparing to receive residents of Kherson fleeing the front lines, Russian state news agency TASS reported. Golubev said the first group of evacuees would arrive on Friday.\n\nGolubev's comments came after Russia's deputy prime minister confirmed Moscow would assist with evacuation efforts, heeding calls from the head of the Kremlin-backed administration in Kherson who had pleaded for help.\n\nA destroyed apartment remains is seen Tuesday in Bakhmut. Yasuyoshi Chiba\/AFP\/Getty Images\n\nThere is now concern that Ukrainian citizens in occupied territory may be forced to go to Russian territory against their will. Reports emerged early in the war of tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians being forcibly sent to so-called \"filtration centers\" before being moved to Russia. Moscow denounced the claims as lies, alleging that Ukraine has hindered its efforts to \"evacuate\" people to Russia. But allegations of these centers stirred painful memories of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's forced deportation of millions from their homelands.\n\nOver the summer, Ukrainian officials in the contested region of Zaporizhzhia appealed to citizens who were in Russian-occupied territory to move away from front lines and into other Ukrainian-controlled territory. If that option was not possible, they advised Ukrainians to use Crimea or Russian territory as a transit route toward Ukraine or a friendly country.\n\nThose on the frontlines in Kherson are now being advised by Ukrainian officials to avoid traveling to Russia altogether.\n\n\"Under no circumstances should you go to the Russian Federation,\" warned Oleksandr Samoylenko, a top Ukrainian official in the Kherson region, on Friday. Samoylenko said that Ukrainian forces were only targeting Russian positions and equipment using high-precision weapons.\n\nSamoylenko's and his deputy, Yurii Sobolevskyi, both accused Russia of trying to Ukrainian citizens out of the region so they could repopulate it with \"zombies who are 100% loyal to Moscow.\" Sobolevskyi alleged that a similar scheme was carried out in Crimea after Russia annexed the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nKherson is one of four regions Russia is now attempting to annex from Ukraine.
